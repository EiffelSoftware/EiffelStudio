Bit operations on INTEGER_64 do not always works correctly.  Bit_shift
causes an "operational stack botched" panic when code is melted.  Some
of the values computed are wrong for frozen/finalized code - shift of
64 positions doesn't work correctly and all values are wrong for
bit_shift.

Discovered in Release 5.4.0403.
