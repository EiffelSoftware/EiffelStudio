			<code>
				<class_name>TIME</class_name>
			</code> and 
			<code>
				<class_name>TIME_DURATION</class_name>
			</code> are designed to deal with high precision in time. The only limit is the one from number representation.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The classes 
			<code>
				<class_name>TIME</class_name>
			</code> and 
			<code>
				<class_name>TIME_DURATION</class_name>
			</code> have an attribute <code><feature_name>fine_second</feature_name></code> (inherited from 
			<code>
				<class_name>TIME_VALUE</class_name>
			</code>) which allows high precision. This attribute represents the number of seconds with fractions (it is an instance of <code><class_name>DOUBLE</class_name></code>). From this attribute are calculated second and fractional_second (which are functions): second is the truncated-to-integer part and fractional_second is the difference between the two previous one, so that the sum of second and fractional_second is always equal to fine_second (see invariant in 
			<code>
				<class_name>TIME_VALUE</class_name>
			</code>).
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>As a result of this, when <code><feature_name>fine_second</feature_name></code> is positive (3.55 for example), <code><feature_name>second</feature_name></code> and <code><feature_name>fractional_second</feature_name></code> are also positive (3 and 0.55). When <code><feature_name>fine_second</feature_name></code> is negative (- 3.55 for example), <code><feature_name>second</feature_name></code> and <code><feature_name>fractional_second</feature_name></code> are also negative (- 3 and - 0.55).</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Manipulation on second and fractional_second are in fact always made through fine_second. Users who do not want to deal with precision do not need to care about this.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Features dealing with <code><feature_name>fine_second</feature_name></code> and <code><feature_name>fractional_second</feature_name></code> are described here.</paragraph>

			<item><code><feature_name>set_fine_second</feature_name></code> allows to set directly <code><feature_name>fine_second</feature_name></code> to a <code><class_name>DOUBLE</class_name></code>. In

			<item><code><feature_name>set_fractionals</feature_name></code> allows to set directly <code><feature_name>fractional_second</feature_name></code> to a <code><class_name>DOUBLE</class_name></code>. In <code><class_name>TIME </class_name></code>a precondition requires that the argument is positive and smaller than one. In 
				<code>
					<class_name>TIME_DURATION</class_name>
				</code> the precondition is particular: it is not allowed to have an argument with a different sign than second. Otherwise, as long as <code><feature_name>fractional_second</feature_name></code> and <code><feature_name>second</feature_name></code> are linked to <code><feature_name>fine_second</feature_name></code>, such a setting would mean that second is also changed and <code><feature_name>fractional_second</feature_name></code> set to a different value. For example if <code><feature_name>fine_second</feature_name></code> = 4.5 (then second = 4 and fractional_second = 0.5) and - 0.8 is the argument of <code><feature_name>set_fractionals</feature_name></code>.
			</item>
		</list>
		<paragraph>The result of that would be<code><feature_name> fine_second</feature_name></code> = 3.2 (then <code><feature_name>second</feature_name></code> = 3 and <code><feature_name>fractional_second</feature_name></code> = 0.2). It is better to prohibit that.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Comment: feature <code><feature_name>set_second</feature_name></code> (from both 
			<code>
				<class_name>TIME</class_name>
			</code> and 
			<code>
				<class_name>TIME_DURATION</class_name>
