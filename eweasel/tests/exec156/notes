A routine which prints `(create {like Current}).generating_type' is
written in class A and inherited by class B.  When the routine is
called on an object of type B, it prints "A" instead of "B".  If
`create {like Current}' is assigned to an attribute of type `like
Current', the generating type of this attribute is also incorrect in
class B.  But if it is assigned to a local instead, the generating
type in B is correct.

Discovered in Release 5.4.0403.
