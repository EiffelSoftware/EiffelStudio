An external routine which is used as the root creation procedure is
declared to take a single argument of type ARRAY [STRING].  When the
external routine tries to access the array, a segmentation fault
occurs.  It is also impossible to declare an external root creation
procedure to take two arguments (one of type ROOT_CLASS_NAME, the
other of type ARRAY [STRING]) even though this is what appears to be
passed to the external routine.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
