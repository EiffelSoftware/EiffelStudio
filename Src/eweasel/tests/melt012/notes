A routine which conditionally raises an exception has a rescue clause
which at first calls the routine itself before retrying, then later
just unconditionally retries.  Executing the system gives the expected
output when the system is frozen, but when it is melted a run-time
panic occurs during execution.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
