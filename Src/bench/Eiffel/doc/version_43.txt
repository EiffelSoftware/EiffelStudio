- Fixed a bug in generation of once function returning an expanded type: 
  the expanded type was not created, thus it was generating mostly a
  Void applied to target.

- Fixed the DESC examples and library files.

- Most of the case of anchored types are now handled correctly:
  - like Current
  - like x, where x is a function or a redefined feature
