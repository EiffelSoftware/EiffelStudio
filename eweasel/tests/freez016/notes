A class has attributes of a generic type using INTEGER_8 as actual
generic parameter.  The generic class has a routine that prints the
generating type of its single generic attribute.  When code is frozen or
finalized, the generating type displayed is INTEGER instead of
INTEGER_8.  Melted code works correctly.

Discovered in Release 5.0.016.
