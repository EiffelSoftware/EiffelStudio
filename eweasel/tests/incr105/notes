After initial compilation, an attribute which is the target of a
creation instruction is moved to a parent class and changed to an
external function.  The compiler detects the VGCC(7) error.  But when
the inheritance clause for the parent is deleted from the heir and
compilation is resumed, the compiler reports a VEEN error but dies in
the middle of reporting it.

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
