A system with a generically derived type whose actual generic
parameter is itself a generic derivation results in a class TEST1 with
an attribute of an expanded type.  When an instance of TEST1 is
created, the attribute is not initialized to the appropriate default
value.  Instead, it seems to be Void, which should not be possible for
an entity of an expanded type.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
