		Factory class to create criteria. 
		
		Example usage:
			
			criterion_1 := factory.create_predefined ("first_name", factory.equals, "John")
			criterion_2 := factory.create_agent (agent last_name_equal (?, "Doe"))
		
		Combining criteria using logical operators:
		
			criterion_3 := criterion_1 and criterion_2
		
		Alternative bracked syntax:
		
			criterion_3 := factory [["first_name", factory.equals, "John"]]
							and factory [[agent last_name_equal (?, "Doe") ]]
		]"
