Colors
------

If you have a color terminal (or your users will have color
terminals) you will probably want to use color. All objects
created have their default colors. You can add a little 
fantasy; there is nothing like discreet but well-chosen color
to make your interface smile.

To change the foreground or background color of an object, use
the Context tool and switch to the `Colors' format. The little
squares at the bottom of the tool will show the various colors
available. A color can be changed by drag-and-drop. Select a
color and drag-and-drop it to either the foreground or 
background hole. You can also type the color name; for possible
values, see the file `$EIFFEL3/build/resource/clr_name'.

If you want to change the colors of another object, to match the
colors of the currently edited object, just select the `Background
and Foreground color' hole of the current object and drag-and-drop
the resulting stone to the object you want to change.
