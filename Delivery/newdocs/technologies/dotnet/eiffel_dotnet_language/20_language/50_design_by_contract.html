		<h1>Design by Contract and Assertions</h1>
		<h2>Motivation: Concerning Correctness</h2>
		<p>When you produce an element of software, how do you know that what you produced
			is correct?</p>
		<p>This is a difficult question for anyone to answer. Informally speaking, correct
			software is software that does what it is supposed to do.&nbsp;That is what
			makes&nbsp;answering the question so&nbsp;tricky. Before you can have any idea
			whether the software is correct, you must be able to express what it is
			supposed to do ... and that proves to be quite difficult itself.</p>
		<p>In conventional software engineering, a document called a software specification
			is written in order to describe what it is that&nbsp;a piece of software is
			supposed to do. Writers of software specifications tend to pursue one of two
			approaches: the informal&nbsp;or the formal.
		</p>
		<P>Informal specifications attempt to describe software behavior in the natural
			languages with which humans communicate on a daily basis. There are problems
			with this approach. Natural language is not precise. Informal specifications
			are subject to interpretation and affected by the ambiguities, noise, and
			contradiction inherent in natural language.
		</P>
		<P>In&nbsp;order to avoid these problems, proponents of formal methods of
			specification turn to the most precise language they know: mathematics. It may
			be no exaggeration that the study of formal methods has&nbsp;produced&nbsp;more
			PhD's in Computer Science than it has well-specified software systems. Still
			the idea that the precision of mathematics can be brought to bear on the
			problem of specifying software is quite&nbsp;appealing. But,&nbsp;problems lurk
			here as well. Formal specifications are difficult and time-consuming to
			construct and verify against themselves, and most software engineers&nbsp;do
			not have a working&nbsp;knowledge of&nbsp;the mathematics required to&nbsp;work
			with&nbsp;formal specifications.</P>
		<P>There is one more significant problem with both of these approaches. Even if you
			have a very precise specification, expressed in elegant text and graphics, and
			placed carefully in an expensive ring binder, how do you know that the software product
			actually reflects that specification and vice versa? If either is changed, the
			other must be as well. This is&nbsp;the document synchronization problem.</P>
		<h3>Design by Contract to the Rescue</h3>
		<P>Design by Contract&nbsp;(DbC) begins as&nbsp;an implementation&nbsp;of&nbsp;some
			of the ideas from formal methods and matures into a powerful way of thinking
			about software. And it does it in a way that is easy for programmers and
			managers to understand. DbC also puts the software specification into the
			software document itself which makes it checkable at runtime and eliminates the
			document synchronization problem.</P>
		<h2>Model for Software Correctness</h2>
		<P>Design by Contract is built around a model for software correctness that is
			really pretty simple.</P>
		<P>Suppose there is software routine called <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN>. If we were going to test <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN>, we would
			probably devise some test inputs or test values to be in place when <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN> starts
			and then observe what things look like after <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN> completes. If they look the way
			we think they should then that leads us to believe that&nbsp;S is working
			correctly for those test inputs.
		</P>
		<P>We can&nbsp;generalize and formalize that process a bit, taking it back from
			testing an into design. If indeed we know what it means for <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN> to be correct,
			then we should be able to make a statement&nbsp;of&nbsp;any conditions that
			must be&nbsp;true prior to executing <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN>. That is, we will state the conditions
			required for&nbsp;it to be possible for <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN> to&nbsp;run correctly. We call this
			statement of preconditions for success&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN>'s
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" keywords="precondition" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex">precondition</MSHELP:LINK>.
		</P>
		<P>Likewise we should be able to make a statement of the conditions that will be
			true always if <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN> works correctly. This we call <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN>'s
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" keywords="postcondition" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex">postcondition</MSHELP:LINK>.</P>
		<P>As an&nbsp;example, suppose <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN> accepted an argument of type <SPAN CLASS="eclass">REAL</SPAN> and returned
			another <SPAN CLASS="eclass">REAL</SPAN> which was the square root of the argument. The precondition for <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN>
			would be that the argument could not be less that zero, as there is no real square root
			for negative numbers. <SPAN CLASS="efeature">s</SPAN>'s postcondition would be that the result
			multiplied by itself would yield the value of the original argument (give or
			take a little to allow for floating point error).</P>
		<h2>Assertions in Eiffel</h2>
		<P>Each Eiffel feature which is a routine, i.e. a function or procedure, can
			support one assertion for a precondition and one for a postcondition.&nbsp;We
			saw where precondition and postcondition fit into the structure of the routine
			in <A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/20_language/20_adding_class_features.html">Adding Class
				Features</A> . An assertion&nbsp;is expressed as one or more assertion
			clauses&nbsp;which are logically <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and</SPAN>-ed together to produce the assertion.
			Assertions clauses are boolean expressions that evaluate to true or false.</P>
		<P>Let's look at another example. Assume you need to produce a class to model a
			time of day. Each instance of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN>&nbsp;would hold some particular time
			of day accurate to the second&nbsp;between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 inclusive.
		</P>
		<P>As a producer, you would be faced with a decision concerning how to maintain the
			time internally in each instance. For the purpose of our example, let us
			consider two alternatives:</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			Keep three instance of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>. One each for hour, minute, and second.
			<LI>
				Keep one instance of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>&nbsp;representing the time of day as&nbsp;the
				number of seconds since 00:00:00.</LI></OL>
		<P>This would be an implementation&nbsp;issue for the producer, because it would
			not affect the services that <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN> could offer clients. If we have a
			query called <SPAN CLASS="efeature">minute</SPAN> the first alternative allows us simply to provide the
			value from storage. Whereas the second alternative will likely cause us to compute <SPAN CLASS="efeature">minute</SPAN>
			each time it is requested. But the service looks and works the same for the
			client in either alternative.</P>
		<P>For now let us assume that we are using the first design alternative. In that
			case we would code class features for <SPAN CLASS="efeature">hour</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="efeature">minute</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN>.</P>
		<CODE>
		<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Access</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">hour</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Hour
			expressed as 24-hour value&nbsp;</SPAN>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">minute</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Minutes
			past the hour&nbsp;
</SPAN>			<BR>
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Seconds
			past the minute
</SPAN>
</CODE>
		<P></P>
		<P>Below is the code for a procedure <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> which receives an argument of
			type <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN> and sets the value of the <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> feature to the argurment.
		</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">INTEGER</SPAN>) <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Set the
			second from `s'</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">do</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> :=
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>
		</CODE>
		<P>The routine is simple enough, but there is a problem with it. Suppose a client
			calls <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> with an argument whose value is invalid,
			say&nbsp;3574.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;routine would just stuff this value into <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN>
			and we would end up with&nbsp;an instance of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN> which is invalid. In
			the days before&nbsp;Design&nbsp;by Contract,&nbsp;as soon as we recognized that
			this&nbsp;problem&nbsp;exists,&nbsp;we would go into "defensive programming"
			mode and code some "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">if</SPAN>" statements inside the routine to validate the argument,
			before acting.</P>
		<P>Consider though what we can do with Design by Contract. We will add a
			precondition assertion to <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> that expresses the need for valid
			arguments.</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>) is&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Set the
			second from `s'</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">valid_argument_for_second</SPAN>: 0 &lt;= <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> &lt;= 59<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">do</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> :=
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>
		</CODE>
		<P>The precondition is introduced by the keyword "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require</SPAN>". The text
			"<SPAN CLASS="eitag">valid_argument_for_second</SPAN>" is the label for the assertion clause. The boolean
			expression&nbsp;"0 &lt;= <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> &lt;= 59" says that a good value for <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> will
			be between 0 and 59 inclusive.
		</P>
		<P>Remember that the precondition specifies those things that must be true if
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> has a chance of working correctly. As such, upon execution, the
			body of this routine will never be executed if an attempt is made to call it in
			a state that does not meet its precondition. Instead, the caller will incur a
			precondition violation exception. We will investigate more about what
			exceptions mean further in <A href="60_exception_mechanism.html">
				Exception Mechanism</A>.
		</P>
		<P>So, what about a postcondition? We noted earlier that a postcondition should
			make a statement of what will be true in the case that the routine does its
			work correctly. For <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> this means that after it finishes, the query
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> should have the same value as the argument that was received from the
			caller. Below is the feature with the postcondition added.</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>) <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Set the
			second from `s'</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">valid_argument_for_second</SPAN>: 0 &lt;= <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> &lt;= 59<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">do</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> :=
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">ensure</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="eitag">second_set</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> = <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>
		</CODE>
		<P>The postcondition is introduced by the keyword "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">ensure</SPAN>". Here the expression
			"<SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> = <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN>" makes certain that the routine did actually do the necessary work
			to ensure that the value of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> matches the value of the argument
			received.</P>
		<P>As you look at the postcondition, you may be&nbsp;tempted to think that the
			one-line body of the routine is so simple as to make the postconditon
			unnecessary. To answer this concern we need to look again for a moment at
			software specification.</P>
		<h3>Specification of a Routine</h3>
		<P>If we remove the instructions from a routine&nbsp;and leave&nbsp;its signature,
			header comment and assertions, we have a specification for the routine.</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>) <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Set the
			second from `s'</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">valid_argument_for_second</SPAN>: 0 &lt;= <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN> &lt;= 59<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; en<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword"></SPAN>sure<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="eitag">second_set</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> = <SPAN CLASS="eitag">s</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>
		</CODE>
		<P>This specification of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> tells us what is required of reuse consumers
			if they wish to use <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> and what <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> promises to do for them.
			Importantly, it does that <EM>without</EM> revealing how it does it does what
			it does.
		</P>
		<P>So, this specification view,&nbsp;officially called&nbsp;the contract
			view,&nbsp;is how consumers of class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN> would view the feature.
		</P>
		<P>If this is the specification, then haven't we put the cart before the horse? The
			answer is yes. We have done so to illustrate the problems that assertion-based
			specification can help solve.</P>
		<P>Instead of starting with a routine and adding a specification, we really want to
			start in accepted software engineering fashion with specification first, and
			then add implementation. Therefore, the specification you see above would exist
			before the implementation.
		</P>
		<P>Now back to the concern over whether the postcondition is redundant for this
			simple one-line routine. Obviously, if this specification exists first, then
			the postcondition must be there, and it would be silly to remove it later. But,
			more importantly, suppose that when the producer of the class decided on an
			implementation, he or she chose the second design alternative we mentioned
			above. This would mean that the internal state of an instance of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN>
			would be only one <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN> with the number of seconds since midnight. That would
			mean that the query <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> would probably be a function that computed seconds
			from that one <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;an attribute.
		</P>
		<P>What would change in the specification of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN>? Nothing. The
			implementation for the routine would be more complex, but what it does, setting
			the second in an instance of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN>, would stay the same.
		</P>
		<P>In summary, the precondition and postcondition ensure for use that the routine
			will only execute if called in a state in which the precondition is true, and
			then will either complete in a state in which the postcondition is true, or
			cause a postcondition violation exception.</P>
		<h3>The Contract for a Routine</h3>
		<P>Having assertions on its routines forms a contract between the <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN> class
			and all potential reuse consumers. The contract is much like a contract in
			business, with obligations and benefits&nbsp;for both parties.&nbsp;</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			The client's benefits are outlined in the postcondition.&nbsp;
			<LI>
			The client's obligations come from the precondition.&nbsp;
			<LI>
			The supplier's obligations are in the postcondition.&nbsp;
			<LI>
				The supplier's benefits come from the precondition.&nbsp;</LI></UL>
		<P>We can see the&nbsp;specifics of&nbsp;these by using <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_second</SPAN> as an example.</P>
		<P></P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			The client gets the desired value for seconds set in the instance.
			<LI>
			The client must provide an argument that is valid for seconds.
			<LI>
			The supplier must update the instance successfully.
			<LI>
				The supplier need not&nbsp;risk disaster&nbsp;attempting to process&nbsp;in an
				invalid state&nbsp;nor&nbsp;waste time validating the argument received from
				the client.</LI></UL>
		<h3>Valid State for Instances</h3>
		<P>Assertions on&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN>'s routines gives us specification for each
			routine and guarantees that if&nbsp;the specification of a routine gets
			violated at runtime&nbsp;we will be served immediately with an exception. This
			will go a long way toward preventing invalid instances from going unnoticed in
			a running system and fouling up lots of other stuff.</P>
		<P>What will help even more is something called a
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" keywords="class invariant" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex">class invariant</MSHELP:LINK>.
			Using the class invariant we are able to state&nbsp;what it means for an
			instance of a class to be valid, or as it is sometimes put, in a stable state.</P>
		<P>The class invariant is an assertion like precondition and postcondition, but
			there is only one per class. Check&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/20_language/10_eiffel_classes.html">Eiffel
				Classes</A> to see how&nbsp;the class invariant&nbsp;fits into the class
			structure.</P>
		<P>How would we code the class invariant for <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TIME_OF_DAY</SPAN>? An instance would be
			valid if its hour were between 0 and 23 inclusive, minute were between 0 and 59
			inclusive, and its second were between 0 and 59 inclusive. We can code the
			invariant as shown below.</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">invariant</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eitag">hour_valid</SPAN>: 0 &lt;= <SPAN CLASS="efeature">hour</SPAN> and
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">hour</SPAN> &lt;= 23<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eitag">minute_valid</SPAN>: 0 &lt;= <SPAN CLASS="efeature">minute</SPAN>
			and <SPAN CLASS="efeature">minute</SPAN> &lt;= 59<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eitag">second_valid</SPAN>: 0 &lt;= <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN>
			and <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN> &lt;= 59
			</CODE>
		<P>The name invariant implies that the assertion can never be false ... and that's
			true up to a point. It's really more like, "it must be true at times&nbsp;when
			it really counts".</P>
		<P>At runtime the invariant must be true for an instance&nbsp;at anytime
			that&nbsp;the instance is available to clients. In general, this means that the
			invariant must be true before and after the execution of every exported
			routine.</P>
		<P>As with the assertions on routines, if ever the invariant is not true when it
			should be, then a class invariant violation occurs.</P>
		<P>Remember in the example above, that the features <SPAN CLASS="efeature">hour</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="efeature">minute</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="efeature">second</SPAN>
			are queries, but they could be either attributes or functions.
		</P>
		<h2>The Contract for a Class</h2>
		<P>Earlier we saw the contract for a routine. Now we can define the contract for a
			class as the aggregation of the contracts for all its exported features, plus
			its class invariant.</P>
		<P>In Design by Contract we design based on these contracts. They are the
			specifications for the modules in our system. We work in a reuse-oriented
			world. Whenever we produce a class, we produce it with a comprehensive contract
			which serves as its specification.&nbsp;We build each class with the thought
			that it may eventually become reusable.
		</P>
		<P>When we are in our reuse consumer role, using existing classes, we tend not to
			look at the implementations for the classes we use. Instead we look at their
			contract views. It is there that we find the obligations and benefits of using
			each class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
		<H2>Contracts and Debugging</H2>
		<P>We saw earlier that having contracts in the code tends to expose bugs at an
			early stage of development. It is possible selectively to turn off and on the
			runtime checking of assertions by changing project settings. Checking
			assertions does involve processing. More about turn off assertion checking in a
			moment.
		</P>
		<P>Having contracts on a class gives another advantage when the contract
			gets&nbsp;broken.&nbsp;The contract tells us whose fault it is.&nbsp;Whenever
			there is a violation of a precondition, postcondition, or class invariant then
			the software is out of specification. This situation is called a defect, or
			bug.
		</P>
		<P>Whose fault is it? If a precondition was violated, then a client class attempted
			to call a routine in a supplier, but made the call in a state that did not
			satisfy the supplier's precondition. Therefore the bug is in the client.</P>
		<P>If a postcondition was violated, then a client made a call in a state that did
			satisfy the supplier's precondition, but the supplier was unable to complete
			the work as agreed. Therefore the fault lies with the supplier.</P>
		<P>If a class invariant was violated, then the
			instance has been placed in an invalid state during the execution of a routine, and left that way when the
			processing completed. This caused the invariant violation. As with the
			postcondition violation, because the problem occurred while executing routines
			in the supplier, preconditions must have been met. The supplier then is to
			blame.</P>
		<P>Based on this knowledge, we can say that it is most practical first to turn off
			runtime checking of postconditions and invariants as we gain confidence in a
			class. Meaning of course, that we feel confident that any&nbsp;calls that meet
			preconditions will be properly processed. Then our only worry is that some
			deranged client will,&nbsp;with total disregard for our carefully crafted
			preconditions, make calls to our routines&nbsp;from invalid states. So, maybe
			we will leave precondition checking turned on for a while.</P>
		<H2>Contracts and Inheritance</H2>
		<P>In the section titled&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/20_language/30_inheritance.html">Inheritance</A>
			you saw that it was possible through inheritance to produce a new class that
			has all the features of an existing one. This is a very powerful notion, and
			could be dangerous. What would keep descendants from redefining inherited
			features with semantics that were totally different from those intended by the
			producer of the original class? Nothing if it were not for the contract.</P>
		<P>Simply speaking assertions on a parent class, preconditions, postconditions, and
			class invariants, all are inherited by the class's proper descendants.
		</P>
		<P>For class invariants, if any new invariants are coded in an heir, they will be
			added to those inherited from the parent, using a non-strict version of logical
			"and" (We will define non-strict booleans in Writing Assertions below).</P>
		<P>That is simple enough. And the situation is also simple for effective routines
			inherited and left unchanged ... the contracts stand as written.
		</P>
		<P>From our example above you may have gotten the idea that contracts are really
			useful only for effective routines. Such is not the case. In fact, specifying a
			contract on a deferred routine is really a powerful notion. It says not only
			that effective descendants must provide an implementation for this routine, but
			also that there is a contract that must be satisfied. Effecting or redefining a
			routine in a descendant class will not make the contract go away. Here is an
			feature from the Base Library deferred class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">ACTIVE</SPAN> which models data
			structures with a current item, and is an ancestor to many effective container
			type classes.</P>
		<CODE>

		<P>Feature <SPAN CLASS="efeature">replace</SPAN> carries the semantics necessary for replacing an item in an
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">ACTIVE</SPAN>. It does not, however provide an implementation. All implementers must
			produce versions of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">replace</SPAN> that satisfy the contract specified here.</P>
		<P>It actually is possible to alter&nbsp;a&nbsp;feature assertion in an effected or
			redefined version(technically its a replacement of the original version):</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			The precondition can only become weaker than in the inherited contract.
			<LI>
				The postcondition can only become stronger than in the inherited contract.</LI></UL>
		<P>These rules are imposed as a consequence of the effect of effected or redefined
			routines on polymorphism and dynamic binding. But, you can understand them from
			an intuitive viewpoint, if you reconsider the business contract analogy.
			Suppose a contractor makes a deal with a client to do certain work (represented
			by the postcondition). Part of the deal might be that the client agrees to have
			a site ready by a certain date (represented by the
			precondition). The contractor represents the parent class in
			the analogy. Now suppose the contractor brings in a subcontractor (representing
			the heir class) to do a portion of the work. The subcontractor cannot force the
			client to change the date that the site is to&nbsp;be ready to an earlier
			date&nbsp;(no strengthing of the precondition). The deal with the client was
			made by the contractor and so no new or stronger requirements can be imposed by
			the subcontractor. Likewise the subcontractor must provide at least as much
			work as was bargained for by the contractor, but may promise to provide more if
			appropriate (strengthing of postcondition is allowed.)</P>
		<P>In Writing Assertions below you will see the syntax for weaking preconditions
			and strengthening postconditions.</P>
		<H2>Unfinished Business</H2>
		<P>In the section <A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/20_language/20_adding_class_features.html">Adding
				Class Features</A>, we promised to explain two issues during this
			discussion of Design by Contract.</P>
		<h3>Short Routines</h3>
		<P>One of these is the tendency of mature Eiffel programmers to write routines that
			are quite short. It should be clear by now that we wish to build a contract on
			each routine. The contract describes the semantics of the routine in a
			declarative fashion. In other words, it tells what the routine does, without
			giving an indication of how it does it.</P>
		<P>Try to imagine giving a declarative description of a routine that was 50 lines
			long. Hardly possible. So decomposition of complex computations into chunks
			small enough to describe with assertions is what gets done.</P>
		<h3>Command/Query Separation</h3>
		<P>In <A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/20_language/20_adding_class_features.html">Adding Class
				Features</A>, we saw that we can categorize features as either queries or
			commands. A query will ask a question or make an observation about an instance.
			A command will tell the instance to take some action which may result in
			changing the instances internal state.
		</P>
		<P>We said that when program routines, that those routines should either be
			commands or queries but not both. Importantly, asking a question about an
			instance should not change the instance. Likewise, taking an action that
			changes the state of an instance should not return a result.
		</P>
		<P>Here's the rationale. In a routines postcondition we use boolean expressions to
			ensure that the routine has done its job properly. Likewise, class
			invariants,&nbsp;which define&nbsp;the valid state&nbsp;for instances,&nbsp;are
			written as boolean expressions. In both cases we may use the features of the
			class which are queries to ask about an instances current state.
		</P>
		<P>If a query that we use in an assertion were to change the state of the instance,
			then the result we received would be invalid as soon as we received it.
		</P>
		<P>Therein lies the primary reasoning behind command/query separation. You cannot
			reason about the integrity of an object if the act of asking a question changes
			the object.</P>
		<H2>Writing&nbsp;Assertions</H2>
		<P>You have seen fairly typical assertions written in the examples above. Study the
			classes in the libraries&nbsp;to see&nbsp;some excellent working&nbsp;examples.
			There are a couple of things that need to be covered.</P>
		<h3>Non-Strict Booleans</h3>
		<P>One is that, as you can probably imagine, it is not a good thing to cause an
			exception during the process of checking an assertion. One of the most common
			ways to cause such an exception is to apply a feature to a Void reference.</P>
		<P>The way to avoid this is to use the non-strict booleans "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and then</SPAN>" and "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">or
			else</SPAN>". These forms of "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and</SPAN>" and "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">or</SPAN>" do not force the checking of all
			conditions. As soon as a determination can be made, they stop checking. It is
			typical to see "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and then</SPAN>" used to avoid applying a feature to a void reference
			in preconditons.&nbsp;Below is a creation procedure that uses a&nbsp;non-strict
			boolean in its precondition.</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_nm</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">STRING</SPAN>; <SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_offset</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">INTEGER</SPAN>) <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment"> -- Initalize
			with name `a_nm' and utcoffset `a_offset'</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">name_not_empty</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_nm</SPAN> /= <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">Void</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">then</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">not</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_nm</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">is_empty</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">offset_valid</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_offset</SPAN> &gt;= -12 and <SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_offset</SPAN> &lt;= 12&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">do</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">name</SPAN> :=
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">clone</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_nm</SPAN>)&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">utcoffset</SPAN> :=
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_offset</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">ensure</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">name_initialized</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="efeature">name</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">is_equal</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_nm</SPAN>)&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<SPAN CLASS="eitag">utcoffset_initialized</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="efeature">utcoffset</SPAN> = <SPAN CLASS="eitag">a_offset</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
		</CODE>
		<h3>Replacing Inherited Feature Assertions</h3>
		<P>
			To replace a precondition on a feature you are effecting or redefining, you use
			the "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">else</SPAN>" keywords to introduce new conditions. These conditions will
			be logically "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">or</SPAN>-ed" with the original precondition to form an new one.</P>
		<P>Likewise use "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">then</SPAN>" to add conditions to a postcondition. The added
			conditions will be "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">and</SPAN>-ed" to the original.</P>
		<P>Below is an example of weakening a precondition. The first feature shown is from
			class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">DYNAMIC_CHAIN</SPAN> in the Base Library.
		</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">remove_left</SPAN>
			<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Remove
			item to the left of cursor position</SPAN>.&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Do not
			move cursor.</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="eitag">left_exists</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">index</SPAN> &gt; 1&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">deferred</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">ensure</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="eitag">new_count</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">count</SPAN> = <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">old</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="efeature">count</SPAN> - 1&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="eitag">new_index</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">index</SPAN> = <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">old</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="efeature">index</SPAN> - 1
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>
		</CODE>
		<P>The next feature is from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">DYNAMIC_LIST</SPAN>, a proper descendant of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">DYNAMIC_CHAIN</SPAN>.
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">DYNAMIC_LIST</SPAN> weakens the precondition it inherited from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">DYNAMIC_CHAIN</SPAN>.
			Originally in <SPAN CLASS="eclass">DYNAMIC_CHAIN</SPAN>,&nbsp;"<SPAN CLASS="efeature">index</SPAN> &gt; 1"&nbsp;was required for
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">remove_left</SPAN>.&nbsp;In <SPAN CLASS="eclass">DYNAMIC_LIST</SPAN>&nbsp;either "<SPAN CLASS="efeature">index</SPAN> &gt; 1" or&nbsp;"<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">not</SPAN>
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">before</SPAN>" (or both) will suffice.
		</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">remove_left</SPAN>
			<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Remove
			item to the left of cursor position.</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Do not
			move cursor.</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require else</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="eitag">not_before</SPAN>:
			<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">not</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="efeature">before</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">deferred</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>
		</CODE>
		<H2 style="LEFT: 5px; TOP: 5118px">Not Writing&nbsp;Assertions</H2>
		<P>Let's close this discussion of Design by Contract with&nbsp;one more interesting
			and&nbsp;point to make about assertions. The precondition and postcondition
			parts of a routine are optional, as you may remember from <A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/20_language/20_adding_class_features.html">
				Adding Class Features</A>. Suppose you write a routine and do not code
			either precondition or postcondition. You might be tempted to think that you
			have simply written a routine that has no contract. But, that would not be the
			case.</P>
		<P>The contract exists, even though you do not code it explicitly. If it were
			written out, it&nbsp;would look as follows.</P>
		<CODE>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_routine</SPAN>
			<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN>&nbsp;
			<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">--&nbsp;My
			descriptive header comment</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">require</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">True</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">ensure</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">True</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>
		</CODE>
		<P>What does this mean? It means that you have selected the weakest possible
			precondition and postcondition for your routine. Of course, this may be
			perfectly valid under some circumstances.</P>
		<P>Just understand that&nbsp;if your routine could speak, it would&nbsp;be telling
			you, "I can always work successfully without any particular guarantees from
			you&nbsp;at all. On the other hand, I won't promise you&nbsp;any particular
			results when I get done."</P>
