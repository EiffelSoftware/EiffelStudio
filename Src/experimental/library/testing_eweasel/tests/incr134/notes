After initial compilation where the system is frozen, an external
routine which has a Special_external_declaration, Signature and
Include_files has its External part simplified to just `external "C"'.
When the system is refrozen, the C code incorrectly uses the old
information about the external routine (prior to the change).  Same
problem with finalizing and re-finalizing code.

Discovered in Release 3.3 beta.
