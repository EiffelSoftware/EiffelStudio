VUPR
        A Precursor is valid if and only if it satisfies the 
        following five conditions:

            1. It appears in a Routine_body.

            2. That Routine_body is part of the declaration
            of exactly one routine `r' of C.

            3. That declaration is a redefinition.

            4. If it is is the redefinition of routines from more
            than one parent, the Parent_qualification part is present.

            5. If the Parent_qualification part is present, its
            Class_name is the name of one of the parents of C from
            which C redefines `r'.

        The "immediate precursor" of r in this case is the routine
        being redefined from a parent of C, determined in case
        of ambiguity (under condition 2 of the rule) by the
        Class_name of the given Parent_qualification.
