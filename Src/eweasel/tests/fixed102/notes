A class with an external routine (which happens to be the root
creation procedure) compiles fine.  When the routine is changed to an
internal routine with three different declarations for the same local,
the compiler detects the VREG violation.  But when the error is
corrected and compilation resumed, the compiler dies with an exception
trace.
