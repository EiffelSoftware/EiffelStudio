			<size>2</size>What is a primitive?
		</heading> A primitive is a Vision2 widget that may not contain other widgets. Primitives may be placed in 
		<link>
			<url>../10_containers/index.xml</url>
			<label>containers</label>
		</link>, but a 
		<link>
			<url>../index.xml</url>
			<label>widget </label>
		</link>may not contain any child widgets. Some examples of primitives are EV_BUTTON and EV_LABEL. A list of all the classes in the primitives cluster may be found

			<size>2</size>Features of a primitive
		</heading>
		<paragraph>  All primitives inherit from EV_TOOLTIPABLE and therefore can have tooltips assigned to them. They all inherit many features from EV_WIDGET  Each descendent of EV_PRIMITIVE will typically have many available features, specific to their type. For example,  EV_SEPARATOR has no extra features, but  EV_LABEL has features for modifying the current font and also the text to de displayed. </paragraph>

		<paragraph>  Although no primitive can contain another widget, certain primitives may contain one or more  
			<link>
				<url>../../20_items/index.xml</url>
				<label>items</label>
			</link>.  One example of this is an 
			<link>
				<url>../../../reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_list_chart.xml</url>
				<label> EV_LIST</label>
			</link> containing  
			<link>
				<url>../../../reference/interface/items/ev_list_item_chart.xml</url>
				<label>EV_LIST_ITEM</label>
			</link>s.
