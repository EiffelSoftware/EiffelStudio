		<paragraph>When creating an attribute, it is common that you will also need a set-procedure for it. For example, for attribute 
			<code>
				<feature_name>property</feature_name>
			</code> you need a procedure 
			<code>
				<feature_name>set_property</feature_name>
			</code> to set it. This feature takes one argument of the same type as 
			<code>
				<feature_name>property</feature_name>
			</code> or is anchored to it. The only thing you have to do with the feature wizard is check the button
			<bold>Generate set procedure</bold>.

		<paragraph>The feature that is generated in addition to the attribute itself is placed in feature clause 
			<code>
				<comment>change Element</comment>
			</code> and is exported to all classes. If you have selected or entered an invariant, the precondition will protect this invariant. Example of a generated set-procedure:
