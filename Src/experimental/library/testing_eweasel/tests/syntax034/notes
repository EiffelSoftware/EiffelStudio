A qualified call to a feature whose name is `e' followed by an
unsigned integer (e.g., `e47') should be legal, but the compiler
reports a syntax error.  The `.e47' in the call `my_feature.e47' is
misinterpreted as a Real constant.  First reported by Bertrand Meyer
on NICE Eiffel Language mailing list.

Discovered in Release 3.3.3.
