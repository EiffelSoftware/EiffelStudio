        <p>In the client-server model of computing, a number of software
        systems, the clients, may require general-purpose services provided by
        other systems, the servers. Clients and servers run concurrently, on the
        same machine or, more generally, on different machines connected through
        a network.</p>
        <p>Typically, the clients are systems, for example systems that provide
        useful facilities for human users; the servers take care of operations
        that clients could not perform on their own (or would perform less
        efficiently), and of operations that are common to several clients.
        Example of servers include:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Computation servers</b>, which take care of heavy or
            specialized computations not appropriate for the clients, assuming
            the servers' processors are more powerful.
          <li><b>File servers</b> and <b>database servers</b>, providing access
            to persistent data that different clients may need to access.<b></li>
          </ul>
          <p></b>The client-server relation is usually many-to-many: each client
          application, in the course of performing its duties, may successively
          require services from different servers; and each server may cater to
          different clients. This second aspect, illustrated by the following
          figure, is particularly important; it allows a single server to
          communicate with as many clients as appropriate.</p>
        <center><img src="fig_1.gif" width="448" height="251"></center>
        <p>Although communication occurs both ways - clients sending objects to
        servers and conversely - the situation in such a scheme is usually not
        symmetric. Whereas a client requesting a certain service will need to
        know beforehand what server provides that service, the server, for its
        part, will not in general name its clients in advance; it will simply
        stand ready to provide its services to whatever suitable client happens
        to request them.</p>
        <p>This dissymmetry appears clearly in EiffelNet and in the examples of
        this manual. It means in particular that clients and servers act
        differently at the <b>beginning</b> of their client-server lifecycle.
        The party that initiates the communication is the client; in this
        operation it will identify the desired server (through a local file name
        for communication on the same machine, or though a machine name for
        network communication). The server simply makes itself ready for
        possible connections by starting to &quot;listen&quot; on the
        communication channels - relying for this on an EiffelNet procedure that
        is indeed called <i>listen</i>.</p>
