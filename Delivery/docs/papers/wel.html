An overview of WEL, the Windows Eiffel Library

<b>
NOTICE: </b> This is a working document. It is being made public
to illustrate our thinking and directions of development, as
well as some of the benefits of the Eiffel way of doing things,
but no part of its contents may be construed as implying any specific
commitment on the part of ISE. The 
design of WEL as documented here may still change.

The example discussed below was chosen as a tested for WEL.
The C and C++/MFC versions were written later on, for purpose of
comparison; they represent the result of our best efforts to implement
the example in these approaches, and should not be construed as
implying any inherent property of any existing commercial product.

you can use WEL, we encourage you to follow the <a href="wel/index.html"> WEL tutorial.</a>

<P>
This note introduces some of the concepts of the new Windows
Eiffel Library (WEL), which has been designed to make Windows
programming easier, more reliable, more convenient, and more
powerful. WEL is the Windows-specific layer of EiffelVision, the portable Eiffel graphics library.
</P>

<H2>
Introduction: more than an encapsulation
</H2>
<P>
The most obvious definition of WEL is that it is an encapsulation
of Windows primitives, making it possible for users of Graphical
Eiffel for Windows to have direct access to the Windows graphical API.
</P><P>
But this is only part of the truth. What you will see through the
discussion below is that for someone whose primary interest is Windows
programming (rather than Eiffel per se), WEL provides considerable benefits
of its own: the ability to work in a much simpler, move convenient and
safer way than if you were using the Windows primitives directly,
for example from C.
</P><P>
This advantage comes from the abstraction facilities of Eiffel,
which make it possible to encapsulate many low-level details
so that developers can concentrate on the functionality, not
implementation requirements.
</P><P>
So even for specific and OS-dependent tasks such as using a particular
graphical API, the benefits of the Eiffel method and of reusable
Eiffel components will show up quickly.
</P><P>
Rather than providing an extensive description of WEL, this note will
illustrate the above points through a commented example, which will
contrast the C, MFC (C++) and Eiffel ways of achieving the same needs.
</P>
<H2>
A small example application
</H2>
<P>
The examnple application writes the x and y position in the window
where the user has clicked. Also, the user must be able
to clear the window by pushing a button. Here is the display:
</P>
<CENTER>
<img border="0" src="../images/xy_wel.gif" width="468" height="334">
</CENTER>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P>
This application needs to catch two kinds of action:
<ul>
<li>
The mouse click in the window.
</li><li>
The `Clear' button activation.
</li></ul>
<H2>
Doing it in C
</H2>
<P>
In C Windows programming, we need to register a class to
create the application's main window (WNDCLASS structure
and RegisterClass function). We have also to write the
application's main loop to get and dispatch the messages
(functions GetMessage, DispatchMessage). All the messages
received by a window are sent to a window procedure (WndProc
function) which must be written by the developper to catch
the user's events (WM_LBUTTONDOWN and WM_COMMAND).
</P><P>
Here is the C program to perform the above:
</P>

<H2>
Doing it in C++/MFC
</H2>
<P>
The C++ version (using Microsoft Foundation Class library) is more abstract
than the C version, but still leaves much to be desired in its encapsulation
of Windows, in particular for such aspects as window styles and the
window creation process. 
</P><P>
Class CMyWindow inherits from CFrameWnd to create a window and a button.
To process the messages, some macros must be called to map a C++ method
into a Windows message (AFX_MESSAGE). The method InitInstance from 
CWinApp must be defined to create the application's main window and show
it. Programmers still have to contend with a lot of low-level details.
This version is slightly longer than the Eiffel-WEL version which follows.
</P><PRE>
#include &amp;ltafxwin.h&gt;
#include &amp;ltstring.h&gt;
#include &amp;ltstdio.h&gt;

#define ID_BUTTON_CLEAR 1

class CMyWindow: public CFrameWnd
{
public:
	CMyWindow ();

	//{{AFX_MSG (CMyWindow)
	afx_msg void OnClear ();
	afx_msg void OnLButtonDown (UINT nFlags, CPoint point);
	//}}AFX_MSG

	DECLARE_MESSAGE_MAP()
};

BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP (CMyWindow, CFrameWnd)

END_MESSAGE_MAP ()

CMyWindow::CMyWindow ()
{
	// Make the main window and a button
	CRect rect (1, 1, 70, 40);
	CButton * button;

	Create (NULL, &quot;Test&quot;, WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,

<H2>
The Eiffel version
</H2>
<P>
Using WEL, the Eiffel version is a lot simpler, clearer - and easier to
write.
</P><P>
It consists of two simple classes, MY_APPLICATION and MY_MAIN_WINDOW.
</P><P>
Class MY_APPLICATION inherits from APPLICATION, a WEL class
which "knows" how and where to dispatch the messages.
All MY_APPLICATION needs to do is to define the application's
main window (routine `init_main_window'). Everything else is taken care
of automatically by the predefined mechanisms of the reusable
library class APPLICATION from WEL. 
</P><P>
In the class MY_MAIN_WINDOW, an heir of  FRAME_WINDOW, we
redefine two routines:
<ul>
<li>
We redefine on_wm_command_control so that it will write the
current cursor position.
</li><li>
We redefine on_wm_left_button_down so that it clears the window.
</li></ul>
That's it.<P>
Here is the first class:
</P><PRE>
	indexing
		description: &quot;A small example of WEL programming, %
					%with a main window, where we can detect %
					%user clicks, and let users clear the window.&quot;
	class
		MY_APPLICATION
	
	inherit
		APPLICATION
	
	creation
		make
	
	feature
	
		init_main_window is
				-- Create the main window.
			do
				!MY_MAIN_WINDOW! main_window.make
			end
	
	end -- class MY_APPLICATION
</PRE>
Here is the second class:
<PRE>
	class
		MY_MAIN_WINDOW
	
	inherit
		FRAME_WINDOW
			rename
				make_top as frame_make_top,
				make as frame_make
			redefine
				on_wm_command_control,
				on_wm_left_button_down
			end
	
	creation
		make
	
	feature {NONE} -- Initialization
	
		make is
				-- Create the main window and a button.
			local
				button: BUTTON
			do
				frame_make_top (&quot;Test&quot;);
				!! button.make (Current, &quot;Clear&quot;,
					1, 1, 70, 40, Id_button_clear)
			end
	
	feature {NONE} -- Behaviors
	
		on_wm_command_control (id_control: INTEGER; window: WINDOW) is
				-- Clear the window.
			do
				if id_control = Id_button_clear then
					invalidate
				end
			end
	
		on_wm_left_button_down (keys, x_pos, y_pos: INTEGER) is
				-- Write the values of `x_pos' and `y_pos'
			do
				position.wipe_out;
				position.extend ('(');
				position.append_integer (x_pos);
				position.append (&quot;, &quot;);
				position.append_integer (y_pos);
				position.extend (')');
				dc.get;
				dc.text_out (x_pos, y_pos, position);
				dc.release
			end
	
	feature {NONE} -- Implementation
	
		position: STRING is
				-- The string that will contain the position indication
			once
				!! Result.make (20)
			ensure
				result_not_void: Result /= Void
			end
	
		dc: DC is
				-- Device context used to write the position
			once
				!! Result.make_by_window (Current)
			ensure
				result_not_void: Result /= Void
			end
	
		Id_button_clear: INTEGER is unique
	
	end -- class MY_MAIN_WINDOW
</PRE>
<P>
Even for such a basic and relatively low-level application, the code
examples speak for themselves.
</P><P>
Note that even though the classes of the example merely rely on
the WEL library mechanisms, they can make some good use of assertions.
The library classes themselves use assertions more extensively
for coherence of design, readability and safety.
