A class inherits from a generic class which has a routine that creates
an entity of the generic type and prints its generating type.  After
initial compilation where the system is melted, the printed result is
correct.  Then the type of the actual generic is changed from STRING
to SEQ_STRING and changes are melted.  Execution then produces the
wrong result (the same result as before).

Discovered in Release 5.0.015.
