	description: "[
		Objects that provide access to a set of shared objects that may be used on a temporary
		basis to increase performance. These objects should only be used in the case where an
		object is required as an intermediary step for passing to a routine, with no further reference
		being kept to the object. By retrieving one of the objects from his class and using it temporarily,
		it prevents memory allocation through the creation of new objects. This can improve performace in
		systems where such access is performed many times in a short space of time.
