ISE Eiffel 4
============

This file contains a summary of the ISE Eiffel installation. For more
complete instructions, please refer to the book ISE EIFFEL: THE ENVIRONMENT.
In case of problems, refer to the web page at
http://www.eiffel.com/doc/problems/.


Installing the Files
----------------------

The installation of the files are done by copying the files from the
delivery medium to the hard disk, for example to directory
/usr/local/Eiffel50. If you have an Eiffel50 on CD-ROM, you can either copy
the whole directory Eiffel50 to your hard disk or run directly from the
CD-ROM.

If the delivery medium is a gzipped tar file, you need to untar the file to
the desired location. For example,

cd /usr/local/Eiffel50
gunzip -c _delivery_file.tar.gz | tar xvf -


Setting the Environment Variables
---------------------------------

Set environment variable ISE_EIFFEL to the Eiffel50 directory you want to run
Eiffel from. This directory can be on your hard disk (for example
/usr/local/Eiffel50) or on CD-ROM.

Set your PLATFORM environment variable to specify you platform.
For example for Linux computers, the value should be `linux'.

Add the following directory to your path: $ISE_EIFFEL/bench/spec/$PLATFORM/bin.

If you chose to run Eiffel from the CD-ROM you have to copy the directory
Eiffel50/install to you hard disk and set environment variable EIF_LICENSE to
point there.


Setting up the License Manager
------------------------------

Run the command `eifid' and send the output to register@eiffel.com.

We will send you registration keys for the products you have
purchased. The keys should be put at the end of the file
$ISE_EIFFEL/install/registration if you run Eiffel from your hard disk,
or $EIF_LICENSE/registration if you run Eiffel from a CD-ROM. After
that you should run the command eiflicense, which will install the
license keys.

In case you are evaluating Eiffel for a trial period, we will send
you a different key and instructions how to install it.

In the limand directory, the file `dhost' must contain one single
line with the name of the machine that will run the license manager:

        % hostname > dhost

Run the license manager:

        % eifdaemon &

Or better:

        % (nohup eifdaemon &)

Or, if you want a log of the connections to eifdaemon:

        % (nohup eifdaemon -l &)


EiffelStudio
------------

Now everything should be Ok and you should be able to run the compiler.
Launch 'ebench' for the interactive graphical user interface of the
compiler of 'es4' for command line interface.
