<h1>Porting an Eiffel application from Unix to Windows or vice-versa</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Before starting your project, you must decide  if you want your 
program to run on either one or more platforms. If you decide to go for more 
than one platform make sure you use platform independent Eiffel libraries or C/C++ 
code. ISE Eiffel provides the following multi-platform libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eiffel2Java (on platform that supports JNI)</li>
  <li>EiffelBase</li>
  <li>EiffelLex/EiffelParse</li>
  <li>EiffelNet (except UNIX specific classes)</li>
  <li>EiffelPreferences</li>
  <li>EiffelStore</li>
  <li>EiffelThread</li>
  <li>EiffelTime</li>
  <li>EiffelVision2</li>
  <li>EiffelWeb</li>
  <li>EiffelWizards</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Configuring your project</h2>
<p>For porting between different UNIX systems, you simply need one configuration 
file as the C/C++ externals should be the same. If they are not the same, as it 
is the case between UNIX and Windows, you will need a configuration file per 
platform where it is different.</p>
<p>Usual case is to port from UNIX to Windows or vice versa. In this case,  
the only difference in your configuration file will regard the external clause. 
For example, an application using Vision2 should contain the following externals 
specification for UNIX platforms:</p>
<pre>external
	include_path:
		"\$(ISE_EIFFEL)/library/vision2/implementation/gtk/Clib `gtk-config --cflags`",
		"\$(ISE_EIFFEL)/C_library/libpng",
		"\$(ISE_EIFFEL)/C_library/zlib",
		"\$(ISE_EIFFEL)/library/vision2/spec/include"
				
	object:
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)/library/vision2/spec/$(ISE_PLATFORM)/lib/gtk_eiffel.o",
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)/library/vision2/spec/$(ISE_PLATFORM)/lib/load_pixmap.o `gtk-config --libs`",
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)/library/vision2/spec/$(ISE_PLATFORM)/lib/libpng.a",
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)/library/vision2/spec/$(ISE_PLATFORM)/lib/libz.a",
		"-L/usr/X11R6/lib/ -lXtst"
</pre>


and the following content for Windows:

<pre>external

	include_path:
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)\library\wel\spec\windows\include",
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)\library\vision2\spec\include",
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)\C_library\zlib"

	object:
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)\library\wel\spec\$(ISE_C_COMPILER)\lib\wel.lib",
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)\library\vision2\spec\$(ISE_C_COMPILER)\lib\vision2.lib",
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)\library\vision2\spec\$(ISE_C_COMPILER)\lib\zlib.lib",
		"$(ISE_EIFFEL)\library\vision2\spec\$(ISE_C_COMPILER)\lib\libpng.lib"

</pre>

<p>Note the `\` in front of the include path for Unix. This is required to 
compile correctly on some UNIX platforms.</p>

<p>Also some multiplatform libraries such as EiffelVision2 do not include the 
same clusters on Windows or UNIX. As for the externals, the clusters need to be 
specified differently depending on the platform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>UNIX systems</h2>

<p>When compiling for many UNIX system, you should finalize without 
launching the C compilation. At the end, the EIFGEN/F_code directory is built. 
This is the portable C code that you can take from one platform to another. 
We recommend you to create an archive of the F_code for backup.</p>

<p>To compile on a given platform, you have to make sure that you have a 
complete ISE Eiffel delivery for the target platform and that your PATH environment variable 
contains $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/spec/$ISE_PLATFORM/bin. Then you have to check that 
all the C externals that you are using have been compiled for this platform.</p>

<p>Then launch the `finish_freezing' script that will 
automatically recompile the C generated code and generate a new executable for 
the given platform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Between UNIX and Windows</h2>

<p>As we have seen above you need to have two different configuration files and 
therefore to port your Windows application on Unix, you need to re-finalize your 
project from scratch on either the Windows or UNIX platform using the 
configuration file for UNIX. Make sure not to compile the C code as if you do it 
on Windows it will not successfully compile.</p>

<p>Once this is done, just follow the above steps for UNIX systems.</p>

<p>For porting your UNIX application on Windows, you need to re-finalize your 
project from scratch on either the Windows or UNIX platform using the Windows 
configuration file. Make sure not to compile the C code as if you do it on Unix 
it will not successfully compile. Then simply executes `finish_freezing.exe' in 
the F_code directory.</p>
