EiffelStore
-----------

Installation 

1. Set up following environment variables:

	setenv EIFFELSTORE <EiffelStore_installation_directory>


2. Installing C-libraries:

   Start your databases kernels if needed (most of the C-libraries are based
   on DBMS libraries, but some of them use a precompiler which needs to acces
   the database kernel). Make sure you are logged as an Oracle user
	as well. Then:

	% cd $EIFFELSTORE
	% install/make_Clib
