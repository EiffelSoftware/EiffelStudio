<h1>Basic text view</h1>
<p>Basic text view <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_format_text_color.gif"> displays the text
of the current feature as it is written in the englobing class.<br>
It does not allow to work with <a href="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/40_debugger/20_breakpoints/index.html">breakpoints</a>
; in order to do this the <a href="./10_flat_format.html">flat view</a> has to be used.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: This view is not available to .NET features which are imported
through by means of an assembly.&nbsp; This is because the assembly .exe or .dll
exposes only the interface methods and therefore is no feature implementation to
display.&nbsp; The feature interface may be viewed, in a clickable format using
the Flat View.
