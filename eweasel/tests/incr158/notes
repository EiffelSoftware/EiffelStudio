After initial compilation, a generic parameter is added to root class,
then a creation clause.  When VSRC error is reported, generics are
removed and creation procedure formal argument is changed to
nonexistent class G.  When VTCT is reported, class G is added,
introducing a VCFG error.  To correct the VCFG error, the name of a
formal generic parameter is changed.  When compilation is resumed,
the compiler dies instead of reporting a VSRP(2) error.

Discovered in Release 5.0.015.
