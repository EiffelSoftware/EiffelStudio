test_name 	expanded-local-no-creation
test_description A routine `f' has a local of an expanded type, but does not reference this local in the routine body.  The base class of the expanded type has a creation procedure.  When the system is executed, the creation procedure of the expanded class is not invoked when `f' is called, but only if the system was frozen.  A melted system works correctly.
