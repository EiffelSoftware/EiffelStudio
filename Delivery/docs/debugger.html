<h2><a name="intro">
1  INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>
   To debug an Eiffel system and, more generally, monitor its execution, you will use a combination of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Project Tool, to start execution steps.</li>
  <li>One or more Feature Tools, to follow execution of instructions.</li>
  <li>One or more Object Tools, to inspect the contents of objects at run time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="tools">
2  ATTACHED TOOLS</a></h2>
<p>
   Besides ordinary Feature and Object Tools, which you will have to retarget explicitly to a certain feature or object, you can use attached
tools, which will reflect the state of the execution. By default, on screen
   larger than 800x600 they will be displayed as shown <a href="#project_tool">below</a>.</p>
<p>
   There are 2 buttons in the middle of the command bar in the Project Tool <img border="0" src="styles/debugg5.gif" width="52" height="23">:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>the left one is to display the attached Object Tool.</li>
  <li>the right one is to display the attached Feature Tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>
   When displayed, the Feature tool will, whenever execution stops, show the current execution position, using the Stop Points
   format as shown <a href="#project_tool">below</a>:</p>
<p align="center"><a name="project_tool"><img border="0" src="styles/debugg6.gif" width="860" height="716"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="example">
3  AN EXAMPLE DEBUGGING SESSION</a></h2>
<p>
   To put a stop point on procedure :</p>
<ol>
  <li>make by drag-and-dropping it into the Stop Point hole <img border="0" src="images/debugg7.gif" width="22" height="19">
    of the&nbsp;Project Tool. The Project Tool display indicates that a stop&nbsp;point has been added.</li>
  <li>accelerator:  Ctrl Shift+right-click</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/debugg8.gif" width="455" height="321"></p>
<p>
   At each stage, the red arrow -> shows the instruction that will be executed next.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
   <img border="0" src="images/debugg9.gif" width="708" height="350"></p>
<p>
   To terminate execution :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ctrl-click the Terminate button in the Project Tool (top-right bar).</li>
  <li>accelerator: Ctrl+E</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="stoppoints">4 STOP POINTS AND STOPPABLE ROUTINES</a></h2>
<p>
   A routine is stoppable if you have put a stop point on the routine as a whole or one of its instructions. Even if you remove the stop point later
on, the routine remains stoppable.</p>
<p>
   Stoppable routines are important because the Single-Step  and To End of Routine  execution formats apply to these routines. For
example if you resume execution in Single-Step format it will single-step through the instructions of the first stoppable routine that it encounters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="interrupting">
5  INTERRUPTING AND TERMINATING EXECUTION</a></h2>
<p>
   You can click the Interrupt button (the little bomb) to interrupt execution&nbsp;at the first applicable instruction of the first stoppable routine to be&nbsp;encountered.<br>
<br>
   To terminate execution rather than just interrupting it, control-click the Interrupt button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="managing">
6  SETTING AND REMOVING STOP POINTS</a></h2>
<p>
   You set a stop point by drag-and-dropping an appropriate element to a Stop Point hole . The elements that can be drag-and-dropped in this
manner are:</p>
<p>
	-Entire routines.
<br>
	-Individual instructions of a routine, which you obtain by targeting a Feature Tool to the routine and selecting the Stop Points format.&nbsp;The clickable element in that case is the three consecutive dots ...&nbsp;that appear to the left of the instruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
   If a stop point has already been set on instruction, the three dots ... are replaced by three vertical bars |||, as illustrated by the last
instruction above.</p>
<p>
   When you set or remove a stop point, the Project Tool display reflects the current Stop Point situation.</p>
<p>
   The Stop Point hole (which you find in both the Project Tool and Feature Tools) acts as a toggle: to remove a stop point, drag-and-drop
it again to the hole. The source of the drag-and-drop can be in a Class Tool (for a routine), a stop point marker (... or |||) in a Feature Tool,
or a stop point indicator appearing in the Project Tool as shown in the last figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="execution">7 EXECUTION INFORMATION</a></h2>
<p>
   When you click the Run button, execution starts or, if previously&nbsp;interrupted, restarts. If it proceeds with interruption and terminates,&nbsp;the message `System terminated' will appear in the Project Tool. But any&nbsp;of the following events may cause execution to stop before
termination:</p>
<p>
	-You click Interrupt .
<br>
	-An exception occurs. (In this case the execution will be interrupted just before the exception, so that you can use the environment's<br>
	 mechanisms to browse classes, features and objects. If you click Run once more the exception will be triggered for good.)
<br>
	-Execution reaches a stop point (except in Ignore Stop Points format).
<br>
	-The next instruction is executed (in Step-by-step  format).
<br>
	-The end of the routine is reached (in To End of Routine  format).</p>
<p>
   In any case, the display will show the execution status and the call stack.</p>
<p>
   All the elements shown are clickable. The local entities of all the routines on the call stack are accessible; to move up and down the
stack, use Up and Down buttons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="multithreaded">
8  LIMITATION IN MULTITHREADED MODE</a></h2>
<p>
   For now the EIFFEL debugger is not fully multithreaded safe.&nbsp;it is possible to put a break-point in any class which doesn't inherit
from the class THREAD, if it is not called in the execution of a thread.</p>
