		<H1>Data Structures Overview</H1>
			<P>
				The data structures cluster of EiffelBase includes classes that cover a wide
				range of data structures classes for you to reuse in your systems. The cluster
				is divided into a number of subclusters. Each subcluster contains one or more
				<B>deferred</B> classes, which provide the general high-level abstractions;
				other classes in the cluster inherit from the deferred ones.</P>
			<P>
				The highest-level class is <A HREF="../../reference/structures/access/container_chart.html">
				CONTAINER</A>, with the following heirs:
				<UL>
					<LI><A HREF="../../reference/structures/access/collection_chart.html">COLLECTION</A>, which describes containers through their access properties (defining how
					to access a container's items, for	example through an index or according to
					a last-in, first-out policy).</LI>
					<LI><A HREF="../../reference/structures/traversing/traversable_chart.html">TRAVERSABLE</A>, which considers their traversal properties, such as sequential or hierarchical.</LI>
					<LI><A HREF="../../reference/structures/storage/box_chart.html">BOX</A>,
					which describes their storage properties, such as being bounded or unbounded.</LI>
				</UL>
			<P>
				The documentation further discusses:
				<UL>
					<LI>The <a HREF="10_taxonomy.html">taxonomy</a> of the
					abstract container structures.</LI>
					<LI>The <a HREF="20_list.html">list-based structures hierarchy</a>.</LI>
					<LI>The <a HREF="30_dispenser.html">dispenser-based structures hierarchy</a>.</LI>
					<LI>The <a HREF="40_tree.html">tree-based structures hierarchy</a>.</LI>
					<LI>The <a HREF="50_set.html">set-based structures hierarchy</a>.</LI>
					<LI>The <a HREF="60_table.html">table-based structures hierarchy</a>.</LI>
					<LI>The <a HREF="70_iteration.html">iteration mechanisms</a>.</LI>
