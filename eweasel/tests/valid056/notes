An assignment whose source is an address expression `$x' (which is of
type pointer) and whose target is a reference type other than ANY should
be rejected, since POINTER does not conform to any reference type besides
ANY.  But the compiler accepts the assignment.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
