After initial compilation, an Expanded Type rule violation (VTEC) is
added.  When the compiler detects the violation, the creation clause
is removed from the class which is being declared expanded by the
client, thereby removing the violation.  But the compiler still
reports a VTEC violation.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
