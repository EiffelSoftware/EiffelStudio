A class prints the generating type of the expression `create {TEST1
[BIT n]' where `n: INTEGER is 8'.  When the system is frozen, system
execution works, except that it prints "TEST1 [BIT_REF]" instead of
the expected "TEST1 [BIT 8]".  When a trivial change is made to the
routine and changes are melted, execution ends with an illegal opcode
panic.

Discovered in release 5.4.0515.
