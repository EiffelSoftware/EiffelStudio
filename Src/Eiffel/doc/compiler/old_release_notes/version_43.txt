- Fixed a bug in generation of once function returning an expanded type: 
  the expanded type was not created, thus it was generating mostly a
  Void applied to target.

- Fixed the DESC examples and library files.

- Most of the case of anchored types are now handled correctly:
  - like Current
  - like x, where x is a function or a redefined feature

- Changed the implementation of `Precursor', the new rule is:

VUPR
        A Precursor is valid if and only if it satisfies the 
        following five conditions:
 
            1. It appears in the Routine_body or the Rescue_clause
            of the declaration of exactly one routine `r' of C.

            2. If the Parent_qualification part is present, its
            Class_name is the name of a parent P of C.

            3. The declaration of `r' in C is the redefinition of a
            routine that has exactly one effective version in the set
            of Parent types of C, restricted if case 2 applies to
            those having P as their Class_name.

- New run-time in DLL and shared library

- Generation of DLLs.
