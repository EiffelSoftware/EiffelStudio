test_name 	 finalize-array-opt-remove-dead
test_description Finalizing a system with an Ace which specifies both `dead_code_removal (no)' and `array_optimization (yes)' causes the compiler to die while generating `eplug.c'.  Finalizing with the -keep option to retain assertions suppresses dead code removal so it also causes the compiler to die if array optimization is on.
