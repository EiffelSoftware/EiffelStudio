After initial compilation, a VJAW error is introduced.  When the
compiler detects it, the creation clause is removed from the root
class and the cluster mark and creation procedure name are removed
from the Ace.  When compilation is resumed, the compiler detects the
VJAW error but dies trying to report it.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
