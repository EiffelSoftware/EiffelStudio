<h1>Multiple inheritance mapping to .NET</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Our goal is to generate a mapping that is both:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Efficient</li>
  <li>CLS compliant</li>
</ol>
<p>Efficiency is always important for a compiler, no one wants their code to run
slowly because the compiler did a very bad job at generating the code. Here
efficiency means to generate as few as possible interfaces to map the Eiffel
classes.</p>
<p>CLS compliant is very important for people who choose Eiffel as a programming
language (mostly because of its benefits: assertions, genericity,...) and who want to produce reusable components.</p>

<p>So far we have two methods and we have decided to go with the second one 
which enables an easy implementation and multiple inheritance between classes of 
different assemblies generated by our Eiffel compiler:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="method1/index.html">Multiple inheritance of interface with single 
  inheritance of implementation with code duplication</a></li>
  <li><a href="method2/index.html">Multiple inheritance of interface and 
  generation of stub for inherited routines</a></li>
</ul>
