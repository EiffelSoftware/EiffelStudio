        <P>EiffelVision 2 is a platform independent Graphical User Interface
        (GUI) library that allows easy, simultaneous development of Windowed
        applications for both Windows &amp; Unix based platforms.&nbsp; Heavily
        relying on ISE's premier EiffelBase library, EiffelVision 2 has been
        designed primarily with ease of use in mind.&nbsp; By reusing EiffelBase
        structures, existing, as well as new Eiffel users will find the learning
        curve of EiffelVision2 to be surprisingly narrow. In no time, users
        will be producing good-looking Windowed application skeletons, of which
        will run on a multitude of platforms with no manipulation of code.<P>
			The EiffelVision 2 library includes the following clusters:
			<UL>
				<LI>A <a href="kernel/index.html"> Kernel</a> cluster that includes classes that are key to a
                  Vision2 application.&nbsp; The main class being <a href="../reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html"> EV_APPLICATION</a>
                  which is the main entry point of all Vision2 applications.</LI>
				<LI>A <a href="widgets/index.html"> Widgets</a> cluster containing classes that used to
                  create Vision2 widgets.&nbsp; Widgets are the visible objects
                  that the user sees and interacts with on the desktop, examples
                  of widgets are windows, buttons and labels.</LI>
				<LI>An <a href="items/index.html"> Items</a> cluster includes the classes needed to create
                  items, items can be thought of as widgets that are contained
                  within only a certain type of widget, such as an <a href="../reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_list.html"> EV_LIST</a> that
                  may only contain objects of type <a href="../reference/interface/items/ev_list_item.html">EV_LIST_ITEM</a>.&nbsp; Items provide an
                  abstract way of dealing with an item widget's internal data
                  structures and provide in many cases the same functionality
                  that a widget does.</LI>
				<LI>An <a href="events/index.html"> Events</a> cluster containing classes that allow for user initiated
                  events, such as the clicking of a button to be dealt with via the
                  use of a linked list of agents (<a href="../reference/interface/events/ev_action_sequence.html">EV_ACTION_SEQUENCE</a>).&nbsp;
                  Agents can be thought of as an object that encapsulates a
                  certain procedure.&nbsp; When a user clicks a button on the
                  screen, the corresponding <a href="../reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_button.html"> EV_BUTTON</a> object has its associating
                  <a href="../reference/interface/events/ev_widget_action_sequences.html#f_pointer_button_press_actions"><SPAN CLASS=efeature>pointer_button_press_actions</SPAN></a> fired and this in turn,
                  fires all of the agents held within, thus calling all of the
                  procedures represented by the agents.&nbsp; Every widget and
                  item has a certain number of <a href="../../base/reference/event/action_sequence.html">ACTION_SEQUENCE</a>
                  objects that are linked
                  with a certain type of event.</LI>
				<LI>A <a href="properties/index.html"> Properties</a> cluster contains classes that allow for the
                  customization of Vision 2 widgets and items.&nbsp; Classes
                  such as <a href="../reference/interface/properties/ev_colorizable.html">EV_COLORIZABLE</a>
                  and <a href="../reference/interface/properties/ev_fontable.html">EV_FONTABLE</a>
                  contain routines that allow for color and fonts to be altered
                  for a widget or item respectively.</LI>
				<LI>A <a href="support/index.html"> Support</a> cluster includes classes that provide more
                  professional touches to an application, whether these are
                  keyboard shortcuts (<a href="../reference/interface/support/ev_accelerator_list.html">EV_ACCELERATOR_LIST</a>)
                  or graphical output (<a href="../reference/interface/support/ev_graphical_format.html">EV_GRAPHICAL_FORMAT</a>)
                  for drawable widgets such as <a href="../reference/interface/widgets/uncommon_widgets/ev_pixmap.html">EV_PIXMAP</a>.</LI>
				<LI>A <a href="pick_and_drop/index.html"> Pick_and_drop</a> cluster that allows for the user-initiated
                  transaction of data between different widgets/items in a
                  system.&nbsp; This involves the setting of a pebble for a
                  widget/item, this pebble can then be sent to other compatible
                  widgets/items via 'Pick and Drop'.</LI>
				<LI>A <a href="figures/index.html"> Figures</a> cluster that allows for the projection of
                  two-dimensional shapes (figures) on to an <a href="../reference/interface/properties/ev_drawable.html">EV_DRAWABLE</a>
                  or printer via the use of an <a href="../reference/interface/figures/ev_projector.html">EV_PROJECTOR</a>.</LI>
