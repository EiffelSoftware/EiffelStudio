feature -- Access

	current_period_end_timestamp: INTEGER
			-- End of the current period that the subscription has been invoiced for.
			-- At the end of this period, a new invoice will be created.

	current_period_start_timestamp: INTEGER
			-- Start of the current period that the subscription has been invoiced for.

	customer_id: detachable READABLE_STRING_32
			-- ID of the customer who owns the subscription.

	default_payment_method: detachable READABLE_STRING_8
			-- ID of the default payment method for the subscription.
			-- It must belong to the customer associated with the subscription.
			-- If not set, invoices will use the default payment method in the customer's invoice settings.	

	items: ARRAYED_LIST [STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_ITEM]
			-- List of subscription items, each with an attached plan.

	latest_invoice: detachable STRIPE_INVOICE
			-- The most recent invoice this subscription has generated.

	metadata: detachable STRING_TABLE [detachable ANY]
			-- Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object.
			-- This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.

	pending_setup_intent: detachable READABLE_STRING_GENERAL
			-- You can use this SetupIntent to collect user authentication when creating a subscription
			-- without immediate payment or updating a subscription's payment method,
			-- allowing you to optimize for off-session payments. Learn more in the SCA Migration Guide.

	status: READABLE_STRING_8
			-- Possible values are incomplete, incomplete_expired, trialing, active, past_due, canceled, or unpaid.
			-- For collection_method=charge_automatically a subscription moves into incomplete if the initial payment attempt fails.
			--		A subscription in this state can only have metadata and default_source updated.
			--		Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an active state.
			--		If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to incomplete_expired.
			--		This is a terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated.
			--
			-- A subscription that is currently in a trial period is trialing and moves to active when the trial period is over.
			--
			-- If subscription collection_method=charge_automatically it becomes past_due when payment to renew it
			--		fails and canceled or unpaid (depending on your subscriptions settings)
			--		when Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts.

			-- If subscription collection_method=send_invoice it becomes past_due when its invoice is not paid by the due date,
			--		and canceled or unpaid if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that.
			--		Note that when a subscription has a status of unpaid, no subsequent invoices will be attempted
			--		(invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed).
			--		After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.	

	collection_method: READABLE_STRING_8
			-- Either charge_automatically, or send_invoice.
			-- When charging automatically, Stripe will attempt to pay this subscription at the end of the cycle
			-- 		using the default source attached to the customer.
			-- When sending an invoice, Stripe will email your customer an invoice with payment instructions.

	in_livemode: BOOLEAN
			-- Has the value true if the object exists in live mode
			-- or the value false if the object exists in test mode.

	plan: detachable STRIPE_PLAN
			-- Associated plan the customer is subscribed to.
			-- Only set if the subscription contains a single plan.	

	plan_count: INTEGER
			-- The quantity of the plan to which the customer is subscribed.
			-- For example, if your plan is $10/user/month, and your customer has 5 users,
			-- you could pass 5 as the quantity to have the customer charged $50 (5 x $10) monthly.
			-- Only set if the subscription contains a single plan.	

	start_date_timestamp: INTEGER
			-- Date when the subscription was first created.
			-- The date might differ from the created date due to backdating.	

	ended_at_timestamp: INTEGER
			-- If the subscription has ended, the date the subscription ended.	

	cancel_at_period_end: BOOLEAN
			-- If the subscription has been canceled with the at_period_end flag set to true,
			-- cancel_at_period_end on the subscription will be true.
			-- You can use this attribute to determine whether a subscription
			-- that has a status of active is scheduled to be canceled at the end of the current period.

	cancel_at_timestamp: INTEGER
			-- A date in the future at which the subscription will automatically get canceled

	canceled_at_timestamp: INTEGER
			-- If the subscription has been canceled, the date of that cancellation.
			-- If the subscription was canceled with cancel_at_period_end, canceled_at
			-- will still reflect the date of the initial cancellation request,
			-- not the end of the subscription period when the subscription is automatically moved to a canceled state.
