<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Breakpoints are entities that stop a debugged application. Breakpoints can be
put at the beginning of each execution line, so that it is possible to see the
context in which the line is executed before executing it.<p>In EiffelStudio,
breakpoints are represented as circles in the left margin of flat forms (both
HYPERLINK(feature flat form) feature flat form and class flat form
HYPERLINK(feature flat form)). Breakpoints can be in three different states:
enabled ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_bpenabled.gif"> ), disabled 
( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_bpdisabled.gif"> ), or not set 
( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_bpslot.gif"> ). Only enabled
breakpoints will stop the application when they are encountered. By default,
breakpoints are not set. Disabled breakpoints are useful to temporarily discard
a breakpoint, while keeping the possibility to put it back quickly.<p>Left-clicking
on a breakpoint in a flat form changes the state of the breakpoint: it switches
from not set to enabled, from enabled to not set, and from disabled to enabled.<p>The <a href="10_breakpoint_menu.html">breakpoint menu</a> lets you change the state of one
breakpoint, whereas
the <a href="20_breakpoint_commands.html">breakpoint commands</a> let you change the state of several
breakpoints at a time. The <a href="30_breakpoint_information.html">breakpoint information command</a> shows the state of all set breakpoints.</p>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note</B>: Breakpoints cannot be set in all features. In particular,
breakpoints cannot be set in external features or attributes.<br>
However, breakpoints can now be set in assertions (require and ensure).</P>
<P CLASS="tip"><B>Tip</B>: Under Windows, breakpoints can now be set on-the-fly
while the application is running.</P>
