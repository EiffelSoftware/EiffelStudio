		<paragraph>  All Vision2 containers inherit EV_CONTAINER</paragraph>
		<heading>
			<size>2</size>What is a container?
		</heading>
		<paragraph>  A container is a Vision2 widget that may contain other widgets. Some containers such as EV_CELL  may only hold one widget while containers such as EV_BOX may hold multiple widgets. As a container is  of type EV_WIDGET, this means that a container may be placed within a container.  A list of the classes held within the container cluster can be found 
			<link>
				<url>../../../reference/interface/widgets/containers/index.html</url>
				<label>here</label>
			</link>.  Windows inherit from EV_CELL  and are therefore classed as containers  also. 
		</paragraph>
		<note>
			<bold>Note: </bold>Containers may only contain other  widgets. Items may only be placed in certain primitives. For  example, an 
			<link>
				<url>../../../reference/interface/items/ev_list_item_chart.html</url>
				<label> EV_LIST_ITEM</label>
			</link> may be contained in an  
			<link>
				<url>../../../reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_list_chart.html</url>
				<label> EV_LIST</label>
			</link>.

			<size>2</size>Inheritance from Base
		</heading>
		<paragraph>  Wherever possible, Vision2 containers reuse the container structures  provided by Base. This provides three main advantages:  
			<list ordered="true">
				<item>Familiarity for operations such as access, insertions and removals. Anybody who already uses 
					<link>
						<url>/libraries/base/index.html</url>
						<label>Base</label>
					</link> should  find it easy to adapt to using Vision2 containers.
				</item>
				<item>The underlying structures used have been tried and tested for many years and their design has been proved to be robust and effective.</item>
				<item>It provides powerful methods of querying the contents. In the original Vision library, you needed to keep reference to widgets as you could not query the contents of a container.</item>  
			</list>
			<paragraph>  For example, EV_CONTAINER inherits BOX and COLLECTION. Descendents of EV_CONTAINER such as EV_BOX may also inherit other structures from

				</link>.

				<size>2</size>Usage of Containers
			</heading>
			<paragraph>The main role of a container is to position its children in a certain way, an 
				<link>
					<url>../../../reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_horizontal_box_chart.html</url>
					<label> EV_HORIZONTAL_BOX</label>
				</link> for example positions it children side by side along the horizontal axis, to get vertical stacking you would use an 
				<link>
					<url>../../../reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_vertical_box_chart.html</url>
					<label> EV_VERTICAL_BOX</label>
				</link>.
				<paragraph>An code example of adding widgets to a container is as follows. 
					<code_block>Missing</code_block>
					<paragraph>The mapping of a Vision2 container interface is very close to that of containers in Base, such as a linked list. 
						<list ordered="false">
							<item>To add a widget to a container call `extend'.</item>
							<item>To remove a widget from the container call `prune'.</item>
							<item>To empty a container call `wipe_out'.</item>
							<item>To traverse the container, you can use features such as start, forth, item and off.</item>
						</list>
						<note>
							<bold>Note</bold>: When a  widget is added to a container, the container is the parent of the widget. 
						</note>
						<heading>
							<size>2</size>Size of widget within a container
						</heading>
						<paragraph>  The size of a widget in a container is always at least its minimum  size. By default, when a widget is added to a container it is  expandable. This means that if the container gets bigger, the  widget will expand to fit the extra space. This convenient  functionality means that you don't have to worry about handling the size  of the widget (such as when a user alters the size of a window) as this  is all performed automatically. If, on the other hand, you decide  you want the widget to remain at a certain size (its minimum size), 
							<link>
								<url>../../../reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_box_chart.html</url>
								<label>  EV_BOX</label>
							</link> contains the convenient call disable_item_resize. 
						</paragraph>
						<heading>
							<size>2</size>Sizing of containers
						</heading>   As EV_CONTAINER is of type EV_WIDGET, the following facilities are provided for setting the minimum size : set_minimum_width,  set_minimum_height and set_minimum_size. It is important to remember that as a general rule, 
						<bold>the current size of a container is always at least the minimum size of all its contents.</bold>
						<note>
							<bold>Note: </bold>The exception to this is: EV_FIXED, EV_VIEWPORT and EV_SCROLLABLE_AREA which do actually allow their contents to be larger than their current size.
