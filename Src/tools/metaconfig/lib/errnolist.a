# This is a simple-minded awk script to generate an initialization for
# sys_errnolist on systems that don't have it.
# This file now depends only on sys/errno.h error numbers under maxerr being
# in order.  It will complain and die if not.  NOTE: It will still produce
# a compilable output file, even with errors, so you must check the output.
