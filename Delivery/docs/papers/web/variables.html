4. ACCESSING VISITOR INFORMATION AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h1>

<P>EiffelWeb provides a set of classes to access information provided by
the visitor, as well as the values of various environment variables.</P>

<h2><A NAME="4.1">Visitor information</A></h2>

<P>When a visitor enters information into a form, the Web server gets it
in a raw, hardly usable form. This is where EiffelWeb steps in: it parses
the information, and makes it available in a form that is convenient for
direct processing by your classes according to your needs.</P>

<P>A given field may have zero, one or move values, depending both on the
field's type and on what the visitor entered in it. In usual CGI processing,
there is no easy way to find out beforehand. EiffelWeb, however, enables
you to obtain the information through a number of queries from class CGI_INTERFACE,
which you can all apply to a field:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The query <I>value_count</I> yields the number of values available
for a field; this is particularly useful when you need to process multiple
values differently from single values</LI>

<LI>In the single-value case, the query <I>value</I> yields that value.
(For multiple values it yields the first one.)</LI>

<LI>In the multiple-value case, the query <I>value_list </I>returns a <I>LINKED_LIST</I>containing
the values.</LI>
</UL>

<P>In the case of checkboxes and similar kinds of fields, your system will
not see any field, not even an empty one, if the user did not check the
box. To find out whether a field is available, use the query <I>field_defined</I>.</P>

<P>If, as is often the case, you know the name of a field, you can just
pass that name as a string argument to any of the preceding queries. You
can also, as in the example of <A HREF="writing.html">section 2</A>, loop over all the fields of the
form, using the array</P>

<UL>
<P><I>fields: ARRAY[STRING]</I></P>
</UL>

<P>and passing the value of <I>fields.item (i)</I>, for various i, to the
above queries.</P>

<P>All the features listed in this section belong to class <I>CGI_INTERFACE</I>,
whose complete specification appears in <A HREF="appendix_a.html">Appendix A</A>.</P>

<h2><A NAME="4.2">Accessing environment variables</A></h2>

<P>A Web server can set a number of environment variables, which will not
change during the processing of a form and so can be represented as once
functions, all returning strings.</P>

<P>These strings are available from features of class <I>CGI_ENVIRONMENT</I>,
whose complete specification appears in <A HREF="appendix_b.html">Appendix B</A>. <I>CGI_ENVIRONMENT</I>
also includes a procedure <I>set_environment_variable</I> to set environment
variables to specific values, useful only for debugging. </P>
