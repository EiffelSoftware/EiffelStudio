		Reads a plain text file and caches it contents.

		The contents are available on a line-by-line basis and provides optimizations for
		consecutive line reads or line reads whose indexes are greater than the previous
		read.

		The cached file contents is not live so any external changes will not be reflected.
		Set `is_contents_auto_refreshed' to automatically refresh the contents when the file is
        changed.
