	description: "[
		An abstract repository with a common interface to 
		read and manipulate persistent objects.
		
		To create a new repository, use the PS_*_REPOSITORY_FACTORY 
		shipped with each ABEL backend.
		
		A repository can be used to execute read-only queries or create
		a new transaction for read-write operations.
		
		It is possible to change some of the default settings
		for performance tuning, such as the transaction isolation level
		or the batch size for lazy loading during query execution.
