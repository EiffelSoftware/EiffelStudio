		A <link><url>../using_eiffelenvision/eiffelenvision_projects/configuring/project_configuration/build_events.xml</url><label>Build Events</label></link> configuration dependent property page has been added to the project configuration properties.

	</paragraph>
    <paragraph>
		The way projects are configured has also changed. EiffelEnvision 2.5 abstracts a number of <bold>Project Configuration Properties</bold> to create a set of <bold>Common Properties</bold> in order to facilitate users in configuring projects faster and with less errors when changing between <link><url>ms-help//MS.VSCC.2003/MS.MSDNQTR.2003FEB.1033/vsintro7/html/vxconBuildConfigurations.htm</url><label>Build Configurations</label></link>. In addition to this abstraction, a number of project Configuration Properties have been added, such as Eiffel <link><url>../using_eiffelenvision/compiling_projects/debug_clauses.xml</url><label>Debug Clauses</label></link> and advanced properties to tweak compilation.
