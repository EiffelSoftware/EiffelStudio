test_name 	 precondition-too-secret
test_description A routine with an insufficiently exported entity in a precondition violates VAPE, but the compiler accepts it.  It appears that the compiler accepts any case where both the routine with the precondition and the entity referenced in the precondition have an export restriction and the entity is not completely secret.
