A system with a 1000 class deep client dependency chain compiles fine.
But when the root class attribute declaration which links it to the
client dependency chain is cut (thereby removing all client
dependencies) and the system is recompiled, a compiler exception trace
results.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.05.17.
