After initial compilation, the file with class FINITE (in a local
directory) is deleted.  When the system is recompiled, the compiler
detects the VTCT violation.  Then FINITE is added back to the cluster
and compilation is resumed.  The compiler later dies with an exception
trace.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
