		<P>The &quot;Editor&quot; folder contains a few options:
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Automatic update when the file has not been modified: This value is used when the text displayed in [BENCH] editor
			has been modified by an external editor since it was opened. If it is True, the content of [BENCH] editor will be
			automatically updated if no change was performed in this editor. If it is False, the users will always be asked if
			the current text should be updated or not.</P>
			<LI><P>Underscore '_' is a word separator: If it is set to True, when moving or selecting word by word, underscores
			will be considered as spaces. If it is set to False, two groups of letters linked by an underscore will be
			considered as one word.</P>
			<LI><P>Quadruple click selects all: If this is set to True, a quadruple click in the editor will select the
			entire text. If it is set to False, if the user clicks three times or more in a row, the current line will be
			selected.
