		<paragraph>The "Editor" folder contains a few options:</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
			<item>Automatic update when the file has not been modified: This value is used when the text displayed in EiffelStudio editor has been modified by an external editor since it was opened. If it is True, the content of EiffelStudio editor will be automatically updated if no change was performed in this editor. If it is False, the users will always be asked if the current text should be updated or not.</item>
			<item>Underscore '_' is a word separator: If it is set to True, when moving or selecting word by word, underscores will be considered as spaces. If it is set to False, two groups of letters linked by an underscore will be considered as one word.</item>
			<item>Quadruple click selects all: If this is set to True, a quadruple click in the editor will select the entire text. If it is set to False, if the user clicks three times or more in a row, the current line will be selected.</item>
			<item>Use tabulations for automatic indentation: If this is set to True, tabulations will be used during keyword automatic completion and text block indentation. If it is set to False, tabulations will be replaced by as many spaces as defined in "Graphical Element" preference folder by "Tabulation size"</item>
