		<h1>Inheritance</h1>
		<P><MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex" keywords="inheritance">Inheritance</MSHELP:LINK>,
			along with
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex" keywords="client/supplier relationship">client/supplier</MSHELP:LINK>,
			are the two relationships that can exist between classes.
		</P>
		<P>Inheritance lets us mirror in software the types of abstractions that are common
			in many problem domains, i.e., the more general to the more specialized.&nbsp;</P>
		<P>Inheritance also gives a way&nbsp;us to combine these abstractions.
		</P>
		<P>Inheritance allows us to make extensions and adaptations to existing software,
			while at the same time, leaving the original software unaltered.</P>
		<H2>The Eiffel Inheritance Model</H2>
		<P>If class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">B</SPAN> inherits from class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">A</SPAN>, then:
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Every feature of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">A</SPAN> is also a feature of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">B</SPAN>
			<LI>
				In any case in which an
				<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex" keywords="instance">instance</MSHELP:LINK>
				of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">A</SPAN> is called for, then an instance of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">B</SPAN> will suffice.</LI></UL>
		<P>Flexibility and adaptability are key&nbsp;qualities of the Eiffel inheritance
			model. On an informal level, this means that, except as prevented by certain
			constraints,&nbsp;a class can inherit from a set of classes
			containing&nbsp;just about any&nbsp;other classes.
		</P>
		<P>Eiffel classes can be
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex" keywords="effective class">effective</MSHELP:LINK>
			or
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex" keywords="deferred class">deferred</MSHELP:LINK>.
			If a class is effective, then it is completely implemented.&nbsp;As a
			result,&nbsp;it is possible to create and use
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex" keywords="direct instance">direct
instances</MSHELP:LINK>
			of an effective class at runtime.
		</P>
		<P>If a class is deferred, then it is not completely implemented. A class is
			deferred if it&nbsp;contains at least one
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex" keywords="deferred feature">deferred feature</MSHELP:LINK>.
			So, it is possible for you&nbsp;to mark a feature (and by&nbsp;consequence also
			its class) as deferred when you code it. This means that the specification for
			this class dictates that such a feature exists, but there is no implementation
			for the feature included in the class. As a result, there can be no direct
			instances of deferred classes at runtime. However, a class that inherits from a
			deferred class can implement, or effect, the deferred features. This results in
			an effective descendant to the deferred class. And it is possible to create
			direct instances of this effective descendant. Such instances would also be
			instances (albeit not direct instances) of the original deferred class.
		</P>
		<P>What this means to us as software producers, is that in any development effort,
			we have available a great number of classes which can serve as potential
			starting points. That is, classes&nbsp;that&nbsp;we could make&nbsp;parents to
			the classes we produce. And, those classes do not have to chosen from a strict
			dichotomy of classes which are either completely abstract or completely
			implemented. Inheritance from classes that are deferred&nbsp;but&nbsp;have some
			implemented features is both&nbsp;possible and&nbsp;encouraged. It reuses
			existing software and it reduces the opportunity for error.
		</P>

			of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN> is shown below:</P>

		</CODE>
		<P>If you are producing a class that you wish to support basic comparison
			operators, like&nbsp;"&lt;" and&nbsp;"&gt;", you can have that class inherit
			from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN>, which has features which correspond to those operators. The
			text for <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN> contains eight features. Seven of these are effective and
			one is deferred.
		</P>
		<P>So through inheritance from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN>, your class, let's call it <SPAN CLASS="eclass">WHATZIT</SPAN>, would
			now have these features available. But how would the features of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN>
			know&nbsp;what it means&nbsp;to compare <SPAN CLASS="eclass">WHATZIT</SPAN>s?
		</P>
		<P>Of course, it would have no way of knowing, so you must show it. And you do that
			by writing the implementation for "&lt;", the one deferred feature that <SPAN CLASS="eclass">WHATZIT</SPAN>
			inherits from the <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN> class.
		</P>
		<P>When you look closely at the effective features of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN>, you see that
			their implementations are ultimately based on "&lt;". If we were not able to
			inherit from multiple partially implemented classes, then we would be forced to
			implement many more features, a process which invites error, or, in the case of
			comparison,&nbsp;to move to a less appealing model.
		</P>
		<H2>The Inheritance Part of Classes in Eiffel</H2>
		<P>Because the inheritance model has such flexibility, it must also have
			adaptability. A consequence of inheriting from multiple classes is that&nbsp;it
			would be possible to&nbsp;inherit multiple features with the same name ... and
			you remember from&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_dotnet_language/20_language/20_adding_class_features.html">Adding
				Class Features</A>&nbsp;that a class is not allowed to have more than one
			feature with the same name. A process called feature adaptation allows us to
			resolve these issues in an heir. Feature adaptation is also done for reasons
			other than resolving name clashes as well.</P>
		<P>Feature adaptation is an enabling capability, but it is also one that takes some
			study to understand fully.
		</P>
		<P>We will look at the types of feature adaptation that will serve most useful to
			you as you begin to produce Eiffel software.</P>
			<P>In&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_dotnet_language/20_language/10_eiffel_classes.html">Eiffel Classes</A>
			you saw where the inheritance part fits into the class structure. Shown below
			is a portion of class&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN>&nbsp;from the Eiffel libraries.
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN> is an effective class which implements the abstract notion of a
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">QUEUE</SPAN> (a deferred class)&nbsp;with an implementation based on the services
			provided by <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_LIST</SPAN> (an effective class).</P>

		<P>Okay ... now calm down ... please. This is an example from a very highly-evolved

			has two parents and uses considerable feature adaptation.&nbsp;In fact, it uses
			every feature adaptation&nbsp;option available. The benefit is obvious,
			though.&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN> class&nbsp;has only seven
			features&nbsp;actually&nbsp;coded.&nbsp;In&nbsp;total there
			are&nbsp;only&nbsp;26 lines of instructions!</P>
		<P>In practice you can use inheritance, even multiple inheritance, to do some quite
			productive programming in Eiffel without having to write anything that looks
			like the inheritance part of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN> above.</P>
		<P>Regardless, let's&nbsp;break&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN>'s inheritance part&nbsp;into
			chunks&nbsp;and take a look at some of them.</P>
		<h3>Rename</h3>

				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">as</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="efeature">ll_put</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>As you might have already guessed, the rename part, introduced oddly enough by
			the keyword "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">rename</SPAN>", is used to rename features.</P>
		<P>Specifically, it is used when an heir wants to use a feature from a parent, but
			wants to use it under a different name than that by which the parent knows it.
			So in the example, the feature known as <SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_LIST</SPAN> is perfectly
			usable in <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN>, but must be applied as <SPAN CLASS="efeature">ll_item</SPAN>.
		</P>
		<P>This is common when your&nbsp;class&nbsp;inherits two different features with
			the same name from two different parents and you want to be able to use them
			both. Because you can only have one feature with a given name, then rename one
			of the features.</P>

				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">readable</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>The new exports part is introduced by the keyword "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">export</SPAN>". This section allows
		you to change the export status of inherited features. Remember from&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_dotnet_language/20_language/20_adding_class_features.html">Adding
				Class Features</A> that features become available (or not) to clients by
			their export status. Export status of immediate features is controlled in the
			feature clause. But here we are dealing with inherited features, so we control
			their status in the export part of the class's inheritance section. Any feature
			not mentioned will have the same export status as it did in the parent class.
		</P>
		<P>In this example, the keyword "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">all</SPAN>" is used first to say that all features
			inherited form <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_LIST</SPAN> are unavailable to any clients (export to class
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">NONE</SPAN>). This is typical for&nbsp;a class like <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN>&nbsp;in which the
			features important to the client come from the deferred parent, in this case
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">QUEUE</SPAN>, and the class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_LIST</SPAN> is used only for implementation. But, it seems
			that also in this case, the producer&nbsp;felt differently&nbsp;about the
			features <SPAN CLASS="efeature">writable</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="efeature">extendible</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="efeature">wipe_out</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="efeature">readable</SPAN>, and decided the
			allow clients of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">ANY</SPAN> type to utilize these features inherited from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_LIST</SPAN>.

		<P>Next, undefine ... it's probably not what you think. You might assume that
			undefine is a way to banish forever any inherited features that you just do not
			want to deal with. But what happens to features whose names are listed&nbsp;in
			an undefine clause is that they become deferred features in the heir.
		</P>
		<P>Undefine is useful if you inherit two different features of the same name from
			different parents, a situation you cannot live with. If you like one and you
			don't like the other, then you can undefine the one you don't like. The the
			only version you get is the one you like.
		</P>
		<P>Another&nbsp;way you might use undefine is&nbsp;in the case in which
			you&nbsp;actually want&nbsp;a feature to be deferred in an heir that was
			effective in a parent.</P>
		<h3>Redefine</h3>
		<CODE>
 			<P><FONT color="darkgray">class <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LINKED_QUEUE [G]
					<BR>
					inherit&nbsp;<BR>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LINKED_LIST [G]</FONT>
					</P>
			<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">redefine</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">linear_representation</SPAN>,&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">extend</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>The redefine part lists the names of effective features for which the producer
			of the heir class would like to provide implementations that replace the
			inherited implementations.
		</P>
		<P>So,&nbsp;in this example&nbsp;the implementation for <SPAN CLASS="efeature">linear_representation</SPAN>,
			for example, that <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN> would have inherited from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">QUEUE</SPAN> will not be
			used. Instead <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_QUEUE</SPAN> implements its own version of
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">linear_representation</SPAN>.
		</P>
		<DIV class="note" id="DIV1" style="WIDTH: 80%">
				<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> When a class implements a version of an inherited feature
					which was deferred in its parent, this is known as "effecting" the feature.
					Because features being effected&nbsp;are getting their first implementation, it
					is not necessary to list their names in the redefine part, or anywhere
					else&nbsp;in the inheritance part of the heir.</P>

		</DIV>
		<h3>Select</h3>
		<CODE>
 			<P><FONT color="darkgray">class <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LINKED_QUEUE [G]
					<BR>
					inherit&nbsp;<BR>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LINKED_LIST [G]</FONT>
					</P>
			<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">select</SPAN>&nbsp;
				<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">remove</SPAN>&nbsp;
				<BR>
			</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>The select part is used only under special circumstances. The case in which
			select&nbsp;is required&nbsp;involves a situation called "repeated"
			inheritance. Repeated inheritance occurs when an heir inherits more than once
			from the same ancestor. Usually this means it has two or more parents who have
			a common proper ancestor (but it can occur directly). The features from the
			common ancestor are inherited by each of the parents and passed on to the heir.
			The rules and effects of repeated inheritance occupy an entire chapter in the
			official Eiffel language reference and will not be reproduced here.&nbsp;Just
			understand at this point&nbsp;that it is sometimes necessary to use <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">select</SPAN>
			to&nbsp;provide the dynamic binding system&nbsp;with an unambiguous choice of
			features in the presence of polymorphic attachment.</P>
		<P>You should note&nbsp;also that repeated inheritance can and does occur often without
			causing any&nbsp;problem at all. In fact it happens in every case of multiple
			inheritance, due to the fact that all classes inherit from class ANY and
			receive its features as a result. The reason it is not a problem is that in the
			case that any feature makes it from the original common ancestor along multiple
			paths to the&nbsp;heir&nbsp;with its name and implementation still intact,
			it&nbsp;will arrive as only one feature heir. This is called sharing and
			nothing special needs to be done to make it happen.</P>
		<H2>Polymorphism</H2>
		<P>It is time now to see another way in which inheritance helps build more
			extendible software.
		</P>
		<P>Assume that we have to build classes that model different&nbsp;types of
			polygons. We would do this by building a class for polygon which would model a
			garden-variety polygon, a multi-sided closed figure. But when we consider that
			there are specialized types of polygons, like triangles and rectangles, we
			realize that to support these specializations, we need classes for them as
			well. And this is an obvious opportunity for inheritance. All triangles and
			rectangles <EM>are</EM> polygons. So, we start with class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN> and its
			proper descendants <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TRIANGLE</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>.</P>
		<P>So we can make declarations like:</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">your_polygon</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_triangle</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TRIANGLE</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">another_rectangle</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN></P>
		</CODE>
		<P>Assume these declarations are in force for all the examples this section on
			polymorphism.</P>
			<P>We saw in&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_dotnet_language/20_language/20_adding_class_features.html">Adding
				Class Features</A> that we can say that one class conforms to another if it
			is the same class or one of its proper descendants. Therefore POLYGON conforms
			to <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN>. Also, <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TRIANGLE</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN> conform to <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN>. But,
			importantly,&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN> <EM>does not</EM> conform to <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TRIANGLE</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>.
			This makes sense intuitively, because we know all rectangles and triangles are
			polygons ... and we also know that not all polygons are rectangles.
		</P>
		<h3>Polymorphic Attachment</h3>
		<P>These facts affect how assignments can work. Using the declarations above:</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> :=
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">your_polygon</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Is valid</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">your_polygon</SPAN> :=

			 <SPAN CLASS="ecomment"> -- Is valid</SPAN>	<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> :=
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">--
				Is valid<BR>
</SPAN>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> :=
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_triangle</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Is valid</SPAN></P>
				</CODE>
			<P>but</P>
				<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN> :=
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Is not valid</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_triangle</SPAN> :=
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Is not valid</SPAN></P>
				</CODE>
			<P>and of course</P>
					<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN> :=
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_triangle</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Is not valid</SPAN></P>
		</CODE>
		<P>Consider now the assignment below&nbsp;which&nbsp;is valid.</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> :=
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>After an assignment&nbsp;like this executes the entity <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> will be
			holding at runtime a reference to an instance of a type which is not a direct
			instance of its declared type <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN>. But conformance ensures us that,
			although it may not be a direct instance, it will indeed by an instance. (all
			rectangles are polygons).</P>
		<P>Depending upon how many different types of polygons get modeled in classes, the
			entity "<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>" could be attached objects of may different types ... it
			could take on many forms. This in fact is the basis for the term
			"polymorphism"; having many forms. So we speak of "polymorphic attachment" as
			the process by which at runtime entities can hold references to objects which
			are not of the entity's declared type ... but they are of conforming types.</P>
		<P>Now let's see how we get some value from this.</P>
		<h3>Dynamic Binding</h3>
		<P>Suppose that one of the features of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN> is a
			query&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>&nbsp;which returns&nbsp;an instance's&nbsp;perimeter.
			The producer of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN> may have implemented <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> as a function that
			computes the perimeter by adding up the lengths of all the sides. This approach
			is guaranteed to work for all polygons, and we can apply the <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> feature
			to any polygon. Let's print some perimeters:</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>)<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN>
				(<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_triangle</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>)&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>)</P>
		</CODE>
		<P><SPAN CLASS="eclass">TRIANGLE</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN> might have properties, expressed as queries, which as a
			part of their specialization, distinguish them from run-of-the-mill polygons.
			Two features of rectangles are <SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="efeature">height</SPAN> the lengths of the sides.
		</P>
		<P>Armed with these <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>-specific features, the producer of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN> may say,
			"Now I no longer have to depend upon that crude implementation of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>
			that is inherited from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN>. I can build an efficient <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>-specific
			implementation of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>, based on the knowledge that for all <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>s
			perimeter = 2*(width+height)"</P>
		<P>To implement this specialized version of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">perimeter</SPAN>, the producer of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>
			must add the feature to the class, but also must list its name in the
			"<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">redefine</SPAN>" part of the <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>'s inheritance clause.</P>
		<CODE>
			<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN><BR>
				<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">inherit</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">redefine</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<BR>
				<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">perimeter</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">REAL</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment"> --&nbsp;Sum
				of lengths of all sides<BR>
</SPAN>				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">do</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">Result</SPAN>
				:= 2 * (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN> +&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">height</SPAN>)<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN><BR>
			</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>You would expect then, that this version of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> would be executed in the
			following context:</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>)</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>But what makes this interesting is that even in the context below</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> := <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>)</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>in which <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> is being applied to a entity declared as <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN>, the
			specialized version of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN> is being used. It would be
			impossible to ensure at compile time which version of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> is most
			appropriate. So it must be done at runtime. This ability to choose the best
			version of a feature to apply, just&nbsp;at the moment&nbsp;it needs to be
			applied, is called "dynamic binding".</P>
		<P>Static typing tells us at compile time that it is safe to apply <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> to
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> No matter which of the&nbsp;types of polygons is attached to
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>, there will be a <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> feature that will work.
		</P>
		<P>Dynamic binding tells us that when we&nbsp;apply <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>, we know that the
			most appropriate version of the feature will get applied at runtime.
		</P>
		<h3>Assignment Attempt</h3>
		<P>Now let's add another situation. Consider the code below:</P>
		<CODE>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> := <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN>&nbsp;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>)<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN>
				(<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Is invalid</SPAN><br>
		</CODE>
		<P>We could apply <SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> and everything is fine ... we
			even get <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>'s specialized version of the feature. But it is invalid for
			us to try to apply <SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> even though we feel (with rather
			strong conviction) that at this point in execution, <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> will be
			attached to an object of type <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>, and we know that <SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN> is a valid
			query on <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>s.</P>
		<P>The reason follows. When we declared <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> as type <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN>, we made a
			deal that says that the only features that can be applied to <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> are
			the features of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN>. Remember that static typing guarantees us at compile
			time&nbsp;that at runtime there&nbsp;will be&nbsp;at least one version of the
			feature available that can be applied.
		</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN>
				(<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Is invalid</SPAN></P>
		</CODE>
		<P>But in the case above, the guarantee cannot be made. <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> is declared
			with class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">POLYGON</SPAN> which has no <SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN> feature, despite the fact that some of
			its proper descendants might.</P>
		<P>Does this mean that we can never do <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN> things with this instance again,
			once we have attached it to <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>?</P>
		<P>No. There is a language facility called the "assignment attempt" which will come
			to our rescue. The assignment attempt will allow us safely to attach our
			instance back to an entity typed as <SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN>. After doing so, we are free use
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">RECTANGLE</SPAN> features.
		</P>

     <CODE>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> := <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN><BR>
 			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>)<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">another_rectangle</SPAN> ?= <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">another_rectangle</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN>)<BR>
     </CODE>
		<P>The assignment attempt uses the syntax "?=", versus the ":=" of assignment.</P>
		<P>This is significant ... as is the name assignment <EM>attempt</EM>. The reason
			is that it is possible in some context that <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> will be attached to
			something other than a rectangle when we do this:</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">another_rectangle</SPAN> ?= <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN></P>
		</CODE>
		<P>If it were true that <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> were attached to an instance of say <SPAN CLASS="eclass">TRIANGLE</SPAN>
			when the assignment attempt above was executed, then <SPAN CLASS="efeature">another_rectangle</SPAN> would
			be left as a <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">Void</SPAN> reference. As a consequence, it is prudent to check to see if
			the attachment has actually been made before trying to apply features. Applying
			a feature to a <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">Void</SPAN> reference will cause an exception. Almost always,
			assignment attempt will be used in the following manner:</P>
		<CODE>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN> := <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_rectangle</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">perimeter</SPAN>)<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">another_rectangle</SPAN> ?= <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_polygon</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">if</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="efeature">another_rectangle</SPAN> /= <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">Void</SPAN>
				<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">then</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment"> -- Make sure assignment happened</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">print</SPAN>
				(<SPAN CLASS="efeature">another_rectangle</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">width</SPAN>)&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</P>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN><BR>
