RELEASE NOTES FOR SGI , ISE EIFFEL VERSION 4.3.
----------------------------------------------

EiffelBench
~~~~~~~~~~~

This release has been compiled on IRIX64 sgi 6.4 with cc.

Please your PLATFORM environment variable to sgi if you
are running on sgi 6.x.  This release is not compatible
with sgi-5.x.

The new EiffelBench interface is not the same as on other Unix platforms, due
to a bug in Motif1.2. You should use Motif2.x.
