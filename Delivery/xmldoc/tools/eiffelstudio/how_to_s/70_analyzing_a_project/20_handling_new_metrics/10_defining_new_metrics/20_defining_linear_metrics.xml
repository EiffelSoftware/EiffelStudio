		<paragraph>To define a linear metric, you must select the <bold>Metric Definition</bold> tab and click the <bold>New metric</bold> button. A menu appears asking you the kind of metric you want to define. 
		Select <bold>Linear metric</bold> and then the type of the results you are looking for (i.e. Class, Feature, Line, ...). Once done, you can perform the following steps:</paragraph>
		<list ordered="true">
			<item>Enter a name for the metric in the "Name" field. Next to the field you will see the type of metric as well as the unit for this metric.</item>
			<item>Enter a description for the metric. The description is shown as a tooltip when you navigate the list of available metrics.</item>
			<item>Define a single term by choosing a metric from the combo box that appears when selecting the <bold>Metrics</bold> column, and then choose a coefficent in the <bold>Coefficient</bold> column of the metric definition list.</item>
			<item>To add other terms, repeat operation 3 as many times as needs.</item>
			<item>Once you have completed the metric definition you need to save your metric by clicking on the Save button.</item>
			<item>If you want to define another linear metric, repeat all the previous steps.</item>
		</list>
	
		<paragraph>A summary of the metric you just defined appears in a textual representation in the <bold>Expression</bold> text field.</paragraph>
