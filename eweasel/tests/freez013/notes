A routine's precondition calls a routine which raises an exception and
then retries and succeeds.  After freezing, system execution works
correctly except that after the last instruction of the root creation
procedure is executed system execution ends with a segmentation fault.
Melted code works fine.

Discovered in Release 4.3-19.
