			To use the APIs of the .NET framework in your Eiffel Sharp systems, you need to emit the external Eiffel classes corresponding to these assemblies.	ISE Assembly Manager provides you with a simple way to do this. The only requirement is that the assembly you want to import to the "Eiffel assembly cache" is signed.<br>
			Once you have imported the assemblies to the Eiffel assembly cache, ISE Assembly Manager gives you another powerful ability: edit types of the imported assemblies. Thus you will be able to change the automatically generated names of class, features and arguments to have a user-friendlier interface. Of course, ISE Assembly Manager will check the consistency of your modifications before saving the changes and updating the corresponding Eiffel classes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the importation time is quite long (a few minutes to up to twenty minutes for assemblies such as `System.Windows.Forms.dll', which have many dependencies), the most commonly used assemblies of the .NET framework are already imported to the Eiffel assembly cache in the delivery. <br>
			Thus you will be able to enjoy the possibility of renaming your Eiffel classes as soon as you get the ISE Assembly Manager delivery.
