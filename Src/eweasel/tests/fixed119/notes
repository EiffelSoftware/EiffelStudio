Freezing a system and then removing a particular cluster from the Ace
file and recompiling violates VTCT, which compiler correctly reports.
Adding the cluster back in the Ace file and hitting return causes
compiler to resume, but it later dies with an exception trace.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.04.21.
Fixed in Prerelease 93.07.15.
