A class creates an instance of a second class stores it in a file
using `independent_store' and then opens the file and retrieves
what was previously stored.  After initial compilation, system
execution works correctly.  Then a local of type `ARRAY [expanded
A]' is added and system is recompiled (frozen).  Execution then
incorrectly ends with a mismatch retrieval error.
