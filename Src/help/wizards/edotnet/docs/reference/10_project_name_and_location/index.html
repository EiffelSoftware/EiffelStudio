			The second screen of the .NET wizard enables you to choose your project name and your working directory. By default the wizard will create an application called "my_dotnet_application" in the directory "C:\my_projects\my_dotnet_application". If this folder does not exist, the wizard will automatically create it. But you can change these settings by typing in the corresponding text field and/or browse for a folder by clicking on `Browse...'.<br>
			You also have to precise if you want the wizard to compile the code it will generate by checking the box at the bottom at the window. By default, the option is selected and the .NET Wizard compiles the generated code.
