A routine has a precondition, postcondition, old expression in the
postcondition and a local entity of an expanded type.  The local of
expanded type is initialized at the wrong time (before the routine's
precondition is even checked), but only if the system is melted.
Frozen code works correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
