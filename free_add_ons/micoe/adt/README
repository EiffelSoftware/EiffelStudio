This is a collection of Eiffel classes representing various
common ADTs. Most of them are not actually used by mico/E
(e.g. the graphs) but we thought you might find them useful
in other projects.

Some of the classes do not represent ADTs but rather encapsulations
of Algorithms. This is true of the matchers (string matching) and
the sorters. The classes in `basic' are adaptations to ISE Eiffel of
classes from the class library of Eiffel/S, which seems to have
died out. Those of us, who grew up with Eiffel/S, became rather fond
of these classes, so they have been resurrected here. Unfortunately
we were not able to resurrect the posh Eiffel/S class FILE.
