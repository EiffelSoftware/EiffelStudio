test_name 	change-anchor-type-finalize
test_description A class has a routine `try (t: like n): like t' which just returns its argument, where `n: INTEGER is 47'.  After initial compilation where the system is melted, the declaration of `n' is changed to `n: DOUBLE is 13.25' and the system is finalized.  System execution then produces the wrong result (13 if finalized with inlining, -NaN if finalized without inlining and -O2, internal compiler error in gcc 3.2.2 if finalized without inlining and -O3).
