test_name 	finalize-expand-creation-order
test_description A system has an attribute of an expanded type, where the base class of this type also has an expanded attribute.  The system compiles fine when finalized, but when the system is executed the creation procedures are called in the wrong order.  If the system is instead melted or frozen, system execution works as expected.
