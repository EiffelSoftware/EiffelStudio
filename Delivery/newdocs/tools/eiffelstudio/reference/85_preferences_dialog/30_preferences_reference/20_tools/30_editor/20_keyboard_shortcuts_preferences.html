		<P>Some of the keyboard shortcuts used in the editor can be customized. A subfolder of the
		&quot;Keyboard Shortcuts&quot; forlder in the editor preferences corresponds to each of these
		customizable shortcuts. There are four values to set to define a shortcut: which key must be
		pressed and whether Ctrl, Alt or Shift has to be pressed at the same time. You will find those
		for values in each shortcut subfolder. The customizable shortcuts are:

			<LI><P>Autocomplete: Shortcut to trigger the feature call automatic completion. The
			default key combination is &quot;Ctrl+Space&quot;.
			</P>
			<LI><P>Search selection: Shortcut to launch a search of the currently selected item. If
			there is no selected item, the editor will look for the next occurence of the last searched pattern. The
			default key combination for this command is &quot;F3&quot;.
			</P>
			<LI><P>Search again: Shortcut to move to the next occurrence of the searched
			pattern. If the shortcut is the same as for Search Selection, the effect of the command
			will be to search for the next occurence of the currently searched pattern unless
			something else is selected in the editor. In that case, the editor will look for the next
			occurrence of the selected text. The default key combination for this command is
			&quot;F3&quot;.
