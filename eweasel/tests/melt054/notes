A routine `try' which has a precondition calls another routine `try2'
which raises an exception.  If the calling routine catches the
exception and retries, the precondition is evaluated again if code is
melted.  Frozen code works correctly - it does not re-evaluate the
precondition in the routine which catches the exception.

Discovered in release 5.3.0620.
