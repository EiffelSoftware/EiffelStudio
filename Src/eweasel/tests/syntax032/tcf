test_name 	 external-proc-sig-return-type
test_description A class with an external feature which is a procedure and which includes a signature that specifies a return type should be called a syntax error (or validity error), but the compiler accepts it.  When the system is frozen, the generated C code won't compile since a void function cannot return a value.
