feature -- Access

	nim_add: INTEGER is 0
			-- Adds an icon to the status area. The hWnd and uID members of the
			-- NOTIFYICONDATA structure pointed to by lpdata will be used to
			-- identify the icon in later calls to Shell_NotifyIcon.

	nim_modify: INTEGER is 1
			-- Modifies an icon in the status area. Use the hWnd and uID members
			-- of the NOTIFYICONDATA structure pointed to by lpdata to identify
			-- the icon to be modified.

	nim_delete: INTEGER is 2
			-- Deletes an icon from the status area. Use the hWnd and uID members
			-- of the NOTIFYICONDATA structure pointed to by lpdata to identify
			-- the icon to be deleted.

	nim_setfocus: INTEGER is 3
			-- Version 5.0. Returns focus to the taskbar notification area. Taskbar
			-- icons should use this message when they have completed their user
			-- interface operation. For example, if the taskbar icon displays a
			-- shortcut menu, but the user presses ESC to cancel it, use NIM_SETFOCUS
			-- to return focus to the taskbar notification area.

	nim_setversion: INTEGER is 4
			-- Version 5.0. Instructs the taskbar to behave according to the version
			-- number specified in the uVersion member of the structure pointed to
			-- by lpdata. This message allows you to specify whether you want the
			-- version 5.0 behavior found on Microsoft Windows 2000 systems, or
			-- that found with earlier Shell versions. The default value for uVersion
			-- is zero, indicating that the original Windows 95 notify icon behavior
			-- should be used. For details, see the Remarks section.
