		<H1>EiffelStudio window overview</H1>
        <H2>Window layout</H2>

        <P>Unlike its predecessor EiffelBench, in EiffelStudio all windows have
        the same components. However, components to be displayed are chosen by
        the user. Moreover, windows have two modes: the edition mode and the
        debug mode. Basically, a standard window looks like this:</P>

		<P>SCREENSHOT(Development window mode edition)</P>

		<P>As you can see, it is divided in several parts: a top section, a left
        panel and a right panel.</P>

        <P>The top part is rather not surprising. It first contains a menu bar,
        which adapts itself to the context of the current project. It also
        contains two toolbars (the main toolbar and the project toolbar).
        Between the toolbars is located the main address bar.</P>

        <P>The left panel contains various <i> tools</i> that help the navigation in the
        system.</P>

		<P>The right panel contains two major tools: the editor and the context
        tool.</P>

        <P>In debug mode, a window looks like this:</P>

        <P>SCREENSHOT(Development window debug mode)</P>

        <P>In debug mode, the same tools are present, but there are two extra
        tools, one in the left panel that can display the current call stack and
        one for viewing the state of objects while debugging.</P>

        <h2>Layout configuration</h2>

        <h3>Tool configuration</h3>

        <P>All tools have similar controls to give their display options. It is
        possible to minimize, restore and maximize all tools by using the proper
        button in their top right-hand corner. Most tools can also be closed. These tools have a close button in the
        corner.</P>

		<UL>
            <li>The minimize button <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_minimize_color.gif"></li>
            <li>The maximize button <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_maximize_color.gif"></li>
            <li>The restore button <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_restore_color.gif"></li>
            <li>The close button <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_close_color.gif"></li>
		</UL>

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: No more than three tools can be displayed at the
same time in the left panel. Trying to add more will automatically minimize one
of the displayed tools, in order to make room for the new tool.</p>

        <P>Tools that can be closed have a corresponding entry in the <b>View/Explorer
        Bar</b> menu. They also have a corresponding button in the main toolbar.</P>

        <P>The only tools that cannot be closed are the editor, and when in
        debug mode the two debug tools.</P>

        <h3>Toolbar configuration</h3>

        <P>Main toolbars can be customized. This allows to select buttons that
        should be displayed in the toolbars, as well as whether an explanatory
        text should be displayed next to icons.</P>

        <h2>Context tool</h2>

        <P>The context tool, located in the right panel, is a major part of
        EiffelStudio. It itself contains several tabs that each correspond to
        powerful functionalities.</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>The <b>Output</b> tab is where general information and error
              messages are displayed
            <li>The <b>Diagram</b> tab uses the BON notation to analyze and
              design a project</li>
            <li>The <b>Class</b> tab gives advanced information concerning a
              class</li>
            <li>The <b>Feature</b> tab gives advanced information concerning a
              feature</li>
			<LI>The <b>Metrics</b> tab provides quantitative information
              concerning a system or some of its components
		</UL>

        <P>By default, all tools refer to the same object. This object can for
        example be a class, a feature or a cluster. However, it is possible to
        separate the context tool from the rest of the window. In this case, all
        left tools refer to the object that is in the editor and the main
        toolbar, while the context tool displays information concerning a
        different object.</P>
