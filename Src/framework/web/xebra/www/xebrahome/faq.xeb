		<h2>"Socket could not be bound!"</h2>
		<h3>Problem</h3>
		On startup, the webapp says <span class="code">[webapp][ERROR in G_XEBRAHOME_APPLICATION] Socket could not be bound!</span>
		<h3>Solution</h3>		
		Make sure no other instance of the webapp is running that would occupy the socket. If no other instance is running, try to wait for a couple of seconds as the socket may be released soon automatically.
