test_name 	finalize-wont-trace-visible
test_description A system's Ace has a visible clause which makes one routine of a class visible.  The class inherits the routine to be made visible from another class along with another routine called by the first and renames both routines.  When the system is finalized with `dead_code_removal (yes)', the generated C code won't compile.
