          every Digit is either one of the decimal
          digits 0 to 9 (zero to nine) or an underscore.

        4 If there is an Integer_base of the form 0b or 0B 
          (binary integer), every Digit is either 0, 1 or
          an underscore.

        5 If there is an Integer_base of the form 0c or 0C
          (octal integer), every Digit is either one of the
