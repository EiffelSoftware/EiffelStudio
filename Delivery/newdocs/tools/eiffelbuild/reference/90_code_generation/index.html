<BODY><H1>Code Generation</H1>
<P>To generate Eiffel code representing your system, select <B>Generate code</B> from the <B>Project</B> menu or click <img SRC="/images/eiffelbuild/icons/icon_code_generation_color.png" > on the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/10_general_interface_description/20_main_toolbars.html">main toolbar</A>.
<P>The length of time taken to generate your code will be dependent on the speed of the system you are running, and the size of your interface, but typically takes a couple of seconds. A progress bar will be displayed during the generation of your system.</P>
<P>The code will be generated according to the options you selected in the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/80_project_settings/index.html">project_settings</A></P>

<H2>Project build type</H2>
<P>If <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/80_project_settings/20_build.html#build_type">build_type</A> is selected as <B>Project</B> in the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/80_project_settings/index.html">project_settings</A>, then the following will be generated:
	<UL>
		<LI>A class named as <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/80_project_settings/20_build.html#window_class_name">window class name</A> setting + '_IMP' representing the implementation of your window.</LI>
		<LI>A class named as <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/80_project_settings/20_build.html#window_class_name">window class name</A> setting representing the interface of your window.</LI>
		<LI>A class named as <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/80_project_settings/20_build.html#application_class_name">application class name</A> setting which is an EV_APPLICATION which will launch your window class.</LI>
		<LI>An ace file which will contain all the information to compile your system.</LI>

	</UL>
