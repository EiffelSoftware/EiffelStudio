<h1>System tree representation</h1>
<p>The cluster tool is mainly composed of a tree representation of the system.
<p>SCREENSHOT(cluster tree)
<p>Here is the meaning of the symbols of the cluster tree:</p>
<ul>
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_cluster_symbol_color.gif"> are clusters
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_class_symbol_color.gif"> are compiled classes
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_class_symbol_gray.gif"> are classes outside the system
	<li>Classes and clusters that are part of a library are shown with brighter
      icon than normal
</ul>
<p>Recursive clusters (ie clusters that have a `all' or `library' tag in the
Ace) have a short name in the tree, but the full name is available as a tooltip.</p>
<p>Left-clicking on any item will send it to the editor. It is also possible to
<A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">pick</a>
items to send them to various components of the development window.</p>
<p><A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">Dropping</a>
a class in this tree representation moves it to a different cluster
(either the cluster it is dropped on or the cluster containing the class it is
dropped on, according to where it is dropped). This is only possible if the
dropped class is not in a library cluster, if its source file is readable and
writable, and if the destination cluster is not a library or precompiled cluster
itself.</p>
