		<H1>Exploring an application dynamic state</H1>
        <p>To view the dynamic state of a debugged application, just stop it at
        the point where you want to see its context. The debugger tools will
        automatically be popped up then, yielding the call stack of the
        application, as well as the state of the objects located in the object
        tree, which include at least the object corresponding to the level of
        the call stack where the call stack cursor
        <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_green_arrow.gif" width="16" height="16">
        is.</p>
        <p>To see at which point the features in the call stack have stopped,
        just double-click the feature on which you want this information in the
        call stack. Doing this will change the cursor position in the call stack
        and display the flat form of the feature in the context tool.</p>

        <p>To follow an object state between pauses of the application, pick and
        drop it into the object tree, which will make it stay in it.</p>
