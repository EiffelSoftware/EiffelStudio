		<paragraph>Notation: a1 // a2</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Applicability: a1 and a2 are the same metric except for a possibly different scope.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Semantics: division</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Resulting unit: RATIO</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Note that since a scope may be a measurement archive, the presence of scope comparisons in our battery of metrics makes it possible to compare current measures to those of a reference archive, for example the previous measurements of a company. The result of a scope comparison doesn't have to be expressed as a raw number or percentage; other possibilities include a percentage variation, such as -25% to mean that the value for a1 is 25% less than the value for a2.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The metric tool provides a command for defining linear metrics. Button
