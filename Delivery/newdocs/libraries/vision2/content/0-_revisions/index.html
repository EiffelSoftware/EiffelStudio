<h1>Revisions and bug fixes</h1>
<p>This document contains details of modifications and bug fixes to the vision2
library listed by the release version of EiffelStudio. All bug fixes and
modifications are relative to the previously released version.</p>
<h2>Eiffel Studio 5.2</h2>
<p><b>Interface modifications</b></p>
<ul class=circle>
  <li><b>EV_TEXTABLE</b> - `align_text_left', `align_text_right' and `align_text_center'
    have been extracted into a new class, EV_TEXT_ALIGNABLE which inherits
    EV_TEXTABLE. All previous descendents of EV_TEXTABLE now inherit
    EV_TEXT_ALIGNABLE, except EV_TREE_NODE, EV_MENU_ITEM, EV_LIST_ITEM and
    EV_TOOL_BAR_BUTTON
  <li><b>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</b> - Now inherits EV_TEXTABLE.
  <li><b>EV_TEXT_ALIGNMENT_CONSTANTS</b> - New class added to support
    EV_TEXT_ALIGNABLE.
  <li><b>EV_MENU_ITEM_LIST</b> - `parent' is now of type EV_ANY, instead of
    EV_MENU_ITEM_LIST as it did not hold for EV_MENU_BAR. The renaming of
    `parent' to `old_parent' in EV_MENU_BAR has now been removed.
  <li><b>EV_VIEWPORT</b> - added `set_item_width', `set_item_height' and `set_item_size'.
  <li><b>EV_TABLE</b>
	<ul class=square>
		<li>redefined `prunable' to `True' and implemented `prune'.</li>
  	  	<li>Added the following features - `set_item_span', `set_item_position', `set_item_span_and_position', `area_clear_excluding_widget', `item_row_span', `item_column_span', `item_row_position' and `item_column_position'.</li>
	</ul></li>
  <li><b>EV_WIDGET</b> - Changed type of `focus_in_actions' and `focus_out_actions'
    from EV_FOCUS_ACTION_SEQUENCE to EV_NOTIFY_ACTION_SEQUENCE. `is_parent_recursive' is no longer available. It has been moved to EV_CONTAINER. This was necessary to fix a catcall encountered using vision2 under .NET. The problem manifested with widgets that held items.</li>
  <li><b>EV_FIGURE</b> - `proximity_in_actions' and `proximity_out_actions' are
    now obsolete.</li>
	<li><b>EV_FONTABLE</b> - `set_font' now sets a copy of the font internally.</li>
	<LI><b>EV_TREE</b> - `ensure_item_visible' and `has_recursively' now take an EV_TREE_NODE as arguments, instead of an EV_TREE_ITEM.</li>
	<li><b>EV_TEXT</b> - `put_new_line' is now obsolete. Use `set_text ("%N") instead.</li>"
	<li><b>EV_APPLICATION_ACTION_SEQUENCES</b> - Added `cancel_actions', fired when a pick and drop is cancelled, and `pnd_motion_actions' fired while the pointer moves during a pick and drop.</li>
	<li><b>EV_TREE_NODE_LIST</b>
		<ul class=square>
			<li>`find_item_recursively_by_data', `has_recursively' and `recursive_do_all' are now implemented in this class, instead of both EV_TREE and EV_TREE_NODE which are descendents.<li>
			<li>Added `retrive_items_recursively_by_data' and `retrieve_item_recursively_by_data' which allow you to specify a comparison criterion, and due to this addition, `find_item_recursively_by_data' has now been made obsolete.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><b>EV_DYNAMIC_LIST</b> - Added `retrieve_item_by_data' and `retrieve_items_by_data'.</li>
	<li><b>EV_ITEM_LIST</b> - Made `item_by_data' obsolete, as you should now use `retrieve_item_by_data' added in EV_DYNAMIC_LIST.</li>
	<li><b>EV_DIALOG</b> - Added `is_relative' and defined `is_modal' in this class, instead of inheriting it from EV_WINDOW.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Platform independent</b>
    <ul>
	<li><b>EV_FIGURE_POLYLINE</b> - Fixed `start_angle' and `end_angle' so that they are computed relative to the first and last polyline segments. This also fixes the start and end arrows, so that when displayed, they now actually point in the direction of their respective line segments.</li>
	<li><b>EV_TREE and EV_TREE_NODE</b> - Fixed `find_item_recursively_by_data' which failed on the `index_not_changed' postcondition. Note that these features are now defined in EV_TREE_NODE_LIST.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Windows</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>EV_RADIO_BUTTON</b> - The default minimum height after `default_create'
        is now enough to display the widget correctly.
      <li><b>EV_CHECK_BUTTON</b> - The default minimum height after `default_create'
        is now enough to display the widget correctly.
      <li><b>EV_NOTEBOOK</b> - When removing a widget from a notebook, it is now
        visible. Previously, the widget would be hidden.
      <li><b>EV_LIST, EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST, EV_TREE</b> - Fixed `set_foreground_color'
        and `set_background_color'. Previously, calling these features did
        nothing.
      <li><b>EV_BOX</b> - If a widget was not`is_item_expanded', then adding a
        new widget to the box before that widget would sometimes cause a
        different widget to become `is_item_expanded'.
      <li><b>EV_TOOL_BAR_RADIO_BUTTON</b> - The currently selected button in
        `peers' was unselected when the button was pressed, and not when it was
        really selected. This bug made it possible to make `selected_peer' Void,
        which caused an invariant to fail.
      <li><b>EV_LIST_ITEM</b> - Calling `enable_select' when parented in an
        EV_LIST now also sets the item as focused in the parent. This corrects
        bugs in keyboard navigation when selecting an item programatically.
      <li><b>EV_FIXED</b> - The minimum size is constrained by the positions and
        sizes of the children (They must be completely displayed), although when
        the positions of the children were reduced, the minimum allowable size
        was not recomputed. This meant that the widget would be enlarged when
        the positions of the children increased, but could never be reduced in
        size when the positions of the children were decreased.
      <li><b>EV_MENU and EV_MENU_ITEM</b> - `set_pixmap' has been implemented as
        previously, it did nothing.
      <li><b>EV_TABLE</b> - re-implemented resizing calculations to fix numerous
        problems when children had minimum sizes. The minimum size now also
        includes the border width when empty.
      <li><b>EV_NOTEBOOK</b> - `selection_actions' were called when you selected
        an item through `select_item', even if the item was already selected. `selection_actions'
        are now only fired when the selection changes.</li>
      <li><b>EV_TREE_ITEM</b> - calling `set_pixmap' twice successively with the same EV_PIXMAP caused a postcondition failure.</LI>
	<li><b>EV_TEXT</b> - Fixed `put_new_line', although it has been made obsolete, as you should just use `append_text ("%N") instead.</li>
	<li><b>EV_SPLIT_AREA</b> - Fixed crash reproducable by inserting an EV_PIXMAP directly into the split area.</li>
	<li><b>EV_CONTAINER</b> - Fixed `propagate_foreground_color' and `propagate_background_color' which failed when one of the children was a descendent of EV_CELL.</li>
	<li><b>EV_APPLICATION_ACTION_SEQUENCES</b> - `drop_actions' was being fired even when the pick and drop was cancelled.</li>
	<li><b>EV_PIXMAP</b> - Previously, if you were to add an agent to an action sequence of the pixmap, before it was parented, the agent would be removed during the parenting.</li>
	<li><b>EV_MENU</b>
		<ul>
		 	<li>Pruning an EV_MENU_SEPARATOR when one or more EV_RADIO_MENU_ITEM were still contained in the menu would cause occasional crashes.</li>
			<li>Previously, when adding an EV_MENU_SEPARATOR, followed by multiple EV_RADIO_MENU_ITEMS, all the items were being selected.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug in `destroy' which was causing postcondition failures.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><b>EV_TITLED_WINDOW</b> - Fixed a GDI leak, manifesting when a window was destroyed.</li>
	<li><b>EV_DIALOG</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed `is_modal' which was previously always returned `False'.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug with `background_color' and `foreground_color' which was not taken into account if the dialog was shown relative or modally to another window.</li>
			<li>If a dialog with a default cancel button was displayed using `show', then minimizing the dialog would cause the system to fail internally.</li>
			<li>Fix bug in `show_relative_to_window' which would cause any associated menus to be removed.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug in `show', as if the dialog had already been shown modelessly to a window, then calling `show' did not show it independently, but still modelessly.</li>
			<LI>Fixed bug with `show_actions' which would be wiped out if you called `show_modal_to_window' and then `hide'.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><b>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</b> - Fixed `text_length' which was returning incorrect value for all descendents.</li>
	<li><b>EV_TEXT</b> - Fixed `line_count' which was previously returning the correct result + 1.</li>
	<li><b>EV_SCROLLABLE_AREA</b> - Fixed crash which occurred when you attempted to use `set_x_offset' or `set_y_offset' before the area had been parented or displayed.</li>
	</ul>
  <li><b>Gtk</b>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EV_WIDGET</strong>&nbsp;- Focus in/out actions are now
        correctly called for widgets that do not occupy their entire space
        allocation such as EV_TEXT_FIELD.
      <li><strong>EV_DRAWABLE_IMP</strong> - Polylines now display correctly on
        big-endian machines (Sparc, PowerPC).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>








<h2>Eiffel Studio 5.1</h2>
<p><b>Interface modifications</b></p>
<ul class=circle>
  <li><b>EV_TEXTABLE and EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</b> - `text' no longer returns Void
    when empty.
  <li><b>EV_WINDOW</b> - `title' no longer returns `Void' when empty.
  <li><b>EV_TOOLTIPABLE</b> - `tooltip' no longer returns `Void' when empty. If
    empty, no tooltip is displayed.
  <li><b>EV_TITLED_WINDOW</b> - `icon_name' no longer returns `Void' when empty.
  <li><b>EV_CLIPBOARD</b> - `text' no longer returns `Void' when empty.
  <li><b>EV_MESSAGE_DIALOG</b> - `text' no longer returns `Void' when empty.
  <li><b>EV_FILE_DIALOG</b> - `file_name' no longer returns `Void' when the
    &quot;Cancel&quot; button was pressed, `Result' is empty instead.
  <li><b>EV_DIRECTORY_DIALOG</b> - `directory' no longer returns `Void when the
    &quot;Cancel&quot; button was pressed, `Result' is empty instead.
  <li><b>EV_CONTAINER</b> - has three new features `set_background_pixmap', `background_pixmap'
    and `remove_background_pixmap'. `background_pixmap' will be tessellated to
    cover complete background area.
  <li><b>EV_TREE and EV_TREE_NODE</b> - Added `recursively_do_all'.
  <li><b>EV_STANDARD_DIALOGS</b>
	<ul class=square>
		<li>`ok_actions' have been renamed in descendents where appropriate. e.g. in EV_PRINT_DIALOG, they are renamed to `print_actions' to match the texts of the associated buttons. Where renamed, `ok_actions' are still available but obsolete.</li>
		<li>Selected button now also returns the correct text of the button (Previously it was always &quot;Ok&quot;).</li>
	</ul>
  <li><b>EV_DIALOG_CONSTANTS</b> - Added new constants required for the above
    change to EV_STANDARD_DIALOGS.
  <li><b>EV_DRAWABLE</b> - `draw_straight_line' now has a precondition to ensure
    the points are not identical.
  <li><b>EV_SPLIT_AREA</b> - seperated `put' from `extend'. They were defined as
    synonyms, but have different behaviour.
  <li><b>EV_DYNAMIC_TREE_ITEM</b> - Added `remove_subtree_function'. Item now
    only shows as expandable if there is a subtree function.
  <li><b>EV_WINDOW</b> - Added `maximum_dimension' which is the greatest value
    allowed for `width' and `height'. This is also the default value for `width'
    and `height'.
  <li><b>EV_OPTION_BUTTON</b> - This class has been made obsolete. It will be
    removed at the next release.
  <li><b>EV_PICK_AND_DROPABLE_ACTION_SEQUENCES</b> - Added `pick_ended_actions'
    which are called when a pick ends.
  <li><b>EV_WIDGET</b> - `set_minimum_height', `set_minimum_width' and `set_minimum_size'
    now all allow 0 as an argument. Previously, 1 was the minimum valid
    dimension.
  <li><b>EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST</b> - `clear_selection' is now obsolete. Use `remove_selection'
    instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Platform independent</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>EV_FIXED</b> - Corrected `set_item_height', which was failing.
      <li><b>EV_SELECTABLE</b> - Corrected postcondition of `is_selected'.
      <li><b>EV_PND_ACTION_SEQUENCE</b> -- `veto_pebble_function' is now only
        called when its argument conforms to the transported pebble.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Windows</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>EV_RANGE</b> - The `maximum_value' could not be set greater than
        32,000. The full range of an INTEGER may now be set.
      <li><b>`focused_widget' from `EV_APPLICATION'</b> - was incorrect if an
        EV_CONTAINER had just received the focus.
      <li><b>EV_PICK_AND_DROPABLE</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Ending a pick and drop on an EV_TOOL_BAR_BUTTON which has a non `void' pebble no longer starts a transport from the button.</li>
		<li>Reduced flicker on cursor when picking from an EV_TREE_ITEM or EV_LIST_ITEM.</li>
		<li>`pebble_function' would previously be called twice during a pick and drop.</li>
	</ul></li>
      <li><b>EV_FIXED</b> - Items contained are now drawn correctly dependent on
        their z order.
      <li><b>EV_DRAWABLE</b>
        <ul>
          <li>`Remove_clip_area' did not remove the clip_area correctly, but set
            it to the current size. This meant that if you then enlarged the
            widget, clipping would be applied.
          <li>Fixed problems with ordering of calls to certain features which
            would cause postcondition violations in the implementation.
          <li>`draw_pie_slice', `fill_pie_slice' and `draw_arc' now have divide
            by 0 protection in the implementation.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>EV_TEXT</b> - `set_background_color' now correctly sets the color
        of the whole background. Previously only the area containing text was
        modified.
      <li><b>EV_CLIPBOARD</b> - Our implementation would sometimes query `text'
        when not allowed by Windows, thus causing postcondition failures.
      <li><b>EV_BUTTON</b> - The result of `text_alignment' after default_create
        was incorrect.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Gtk</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Gtk version of Studio released (including Vision2), so no fixes from
        5.0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
