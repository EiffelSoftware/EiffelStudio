# Introduction

The basic idea of a filter is to pre-process incoming data and post-process outgoing data.
Filters are part of a filter chain, thus following the [chain of responsability design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern).

Each filter decides to call the next filter or not.
