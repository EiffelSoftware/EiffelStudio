note
	description: "[
			When calling encryptor() or decryptor() on a SSL_CIPHER object the result will conform to the SSL_CIPHER_CONTEXT interface. 
			You can then call update(data) with data until you have fed everything into the context. Once that is done call finalize() to finish the operation and obtain the remainder of the data.
			
			Block ciphers require that the plaintext or ciphertext always be a multiple of their block size. 
			Because of that padding is sometimes required to make a message the correct size. 
			SSL_CIPHER_CONTEXT will not automatically apply any padding; you’ll need to add your own. 
			For block ciphers the recommended padding is PKCS7. If you are using a stream cipher mode (such as CTR) you don’t have to worry about this.
