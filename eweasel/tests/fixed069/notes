A particular system is compiled, finish_freezing is done and the
system executes correctly.  Then all instructions are deleted from the
body of the root creation procedure and es3 is rerun.  When the system
is executed again, the old deleted body appears to be still executed.
Running es3 again with no changes results in an exception trace.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
Fixed in Prerelease 93.04.21.
