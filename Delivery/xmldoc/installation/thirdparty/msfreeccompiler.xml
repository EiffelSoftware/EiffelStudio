		<paragraph>The Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 includes the core tools developers need to compile and link C++ based applications for Windows 
		and the .NET Common Language Runtime.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>This document describes how to setup the Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 and compile Eiffel systems using it.  
		</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The steps required to setup the C++ compiler include installing the toolkit, installing the Windows Platform SDK, and setting up your system environment 
			variables for the needed include, header, library and binary needed files during the C compilation.</paragraph>
		<list ordered="true">		
			<item>Download and install the <link><label>Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003</label><url>http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/</url></link>.  For this documentation we assume your installation location is 
				<italic>&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ ToolKit 2003&quot;</italic>.
			</item>
			<item>Download and install the 
				<link>
					<label>Microsoft Platform SDK</label>
					<url>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5</url>
				</link>.
				  Assume for this document it is installed at 
				<italic>&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK&quot;</italic> and substitute this with appropriate location on your system when necessary.
			</item>
			<item>Setup your environment variables.  Make sure your <bold>INCLUDE</bold> path has the following (substituting the appropriate locations with your actual values for the installed packages):
			
				<code_block>INCLUDE=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ ToolKit 2003\include</code_block>
			
			<paragraph>Make sure your <bold>LIB</bold> path has the following:</paragraph>
			
			<code_block>LIB=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ ToolKit 2003\lib</code_block>
			
			<paragraph>Your <bold>PATH</bold> environment variable should also contain the path to the C compiler bin directory, you can set it by doing the following:
				<code_block>PATH=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual C++ ToolKit 2003\bin;%PATH%</code_block>
			</paragraph>

			However this is not complete, you also need access to the following four binary files: nmake.exe, lib.exe, cvtres.exe and msvcr80.dll.
			These programs are provided in the Platform SDK and can be easily found by searching for them. Their location may differ depending on the exact version of the SDK you downloaded.  
			For example on a system with the Windows Server 2003 SDK it is in <italic>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Bin\Win64</italic>. To access them, you may choose to add this location to your path (after the
			location of the C compiler bin directory), by doing:
			
			<code_block>PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Bin\Win64</code_block>
			
			<paragraph>Or you may prefer to copy these 4 files into the C Compiler bin directory.</paragraph>
			</item>
		</list>If this is all done correctly you should now be able to use the Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 when compiling your Eiffel systems.
