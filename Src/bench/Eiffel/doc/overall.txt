A Standard Eiffel Compilation:
------------------------------

Degree 6:
---------

Two choices are offered to the users:
- Melt
- Quick-melt

Melt:
	If the system is using some precompiled libraries, the LACE_I.recompile or 
	LACE_I.do_recompilation will merge the precompiled libraries into the system.

	Then we take all the remaining classes which are specified in the Ace file and
	we make them available to the compiler

Quick-Melt:
	We check all the compiled class of the compiler and we check if they have
	changed, if so we put them in `pass1_controler'

Between Degree 6 and 5:
-----------------------

Before to start everything we check the validity of the precompilations.
Then we check the validity of the added/removed classes.

Set the value of `poofter_intialization' to True only when a class has been changed.
This is used for the finalization process (still mysterious!!)

Degree 5:
---------

We do a pass on `pass1_controler' and we apply execute from PASS1_C on each item,
and then we remove the current item and we redo for the next one.

For each item, if it is marked as `new_compilation' we reparsed it again, if not
we retrieve the AST from either the TMP_AST_SERVER or AST_SERVER.

1 - We first check that all the class used (both real suppliers and parents) in the Current
class are part of the Universe, otherwise we generate a VTCT error message. When they
are part of the Universe and not yet compiled, we add them in the `pass1_controller'
and we create an associated CLASS_C.

2 - We create an instance of CLASS_INFO with the list of parents for the current class
and also the list of the creators of the Current class.

3 - Init current instance of CLASS_C:
a) Insert obsolete_message into CLASS_C
b) If the class was already compiled, we remove the class from all the descendants list
   of each parent (I.e. as if we removed the class from the system).
c) If the class has changed the `deferred' status and if the class had some parents
   we insert the class into `pass2_controler', and set `changed_status' to True.
d) If the class is expanded we set the system to have an expanded type.
e) If the class has changed its `expanded' status and if the class had some parents
   we insert it into `pass2_controler' and set `changed_status' and `changed_expanded'
f) If the class is separate we set the system to have a separate type.
g) If the class has changed its `separate' status and if the class had some parents
   we insert it into `pass2_controler' and set `changed_status' and `changed_separate'

h) If the class has the `changed_status' flag, then we loop through all the syntactical
   clients. If the class has changed its status for `expanded' or `separate' we insert
   the client into `pass1_controler' if it does not have is `changed' flag set.
   For all the clients we insert them into`pass2_controler', `pass3_controler'
   and `pass4_controler' 
   For each class_type of the current class, we mark it as `changed' and update the
   `expanded' flag.

i) If class has `parents' we go through each parent:
	- first loop, we make sure that we do not have a `like' declaration, if there is one
	  we generate a VE04 error.
	- second loop, we update the corresponding CLASS_INFO.parents structures and the
	  `parents' attributes of CLASS_C with the parents taken from the PARENT_AS node.
	  we also add `Current' into the descendant of the parents CLASS_C.

   Else if the class is not GENERAL, we add ANY as a parent of Current and add Current
   as a descendant of ANY

   If it is GENERAL we do nothing special.

j) We now check if the class has some generic parameters. If there is some, we check their
   validity, i.e. valid only if it is not a name of the surrounding universe, and if the name
   does not appear twice in the declaration.

k) If the class has its generic declaration part changed in one or two way, we marked
   it as `changed_generics'.

l) If `changed_generics', we add all the syntactical clients into `pass2_controler',
   `pass3_controler' and `pass4_controler'.
   We also update the syntactical relations, i.e we removed the current class from all
   the suppliers and update the new syntactical relations. 
   We removed the class from the system and add it again in all the `controlers'.

m) Check if between two compilations we changed the inheritance.
   If so, we marked the current class as `changed', `changed3a', and we need to mark
   SYSTEM_I to `update_sort'
   If not, we still need to do some work on it later, so we marked as `changed2'.

   If it is the first compilation, we just marked SYSTEM_I to `update_sort'

   There is a `if' statement which is never satisfied for `Conformance tables incrementality'

4) We have a checksum for errors.

5) If class is still part of the system, we do:
a) Update the syntactical clients
b) We set an id to the AST and we put it in TMP_AST_SERVER
c) If the class a `unique' declaration we initialize the `unique_counter' and compute
   the unique values with the AST and put the result in the corresponding CLASS_INFO.
d) Get the index from the TMP_AST_SERVER for the just parsed class, and the invariant_info
   and put them in the CLASS_INFO. We put the invariant_info into TMP_INV_AST_SERVER
   We put CLASS_INFO into TMP_CLASS_INFO_SERVER
   We clear the index of TMP_AST_SERVER
e) We clean the `filters'.

Note and improvements:
----------------------

1 - There is maybe a possibility to merge all the `passx_controler' into one pass
2 - In `init' from CLASS_C, we have to remove all the call which add `Current' into
    the controler and do it only once when `changed_status' is true.
3 - In point 3-i) we can merge the two traversals of the `parents'
4 - We can maybe get rid of `update_syntactical_relations' in `init' from CLASS_C (3-l) point)
    since the call which just follows will delete all the added information.
5 - There seems to be a problem with the inheritance removal bug that Michael fixed in
    September 97.
6 - We absolutely need to save the result of `same_parents' 3-m) otherwise we compute it
    twice (and this is not a nice algorithm: two loops with a loop inside -((()
6bis - What is written in 6 is stupid, because we can remove the full statement.
    There is a `if' statement which is never satisfied for `Conformance tables incrementality'
	which needs to be removed


Between Degree 5 and 4:
-----------------------

Check generic paramaters of classes which have not been recompiled because one of their
generic parameter can become a name of a new added class.

If we are using a root class, it means that we are not in precompiled or compile all classes
mode and as a consequence we need to make sure that the root class us not generic. We also
need to remove all the useless classes (i.e. classes which are not part of the living
universe anymore).

If `update_sort' or if a class has been moved (added or removed) we need to redo a
topological sort on `sorter', `pass2_controler', `pass3_controler' and `pass4_controler'.
And then we have to rebuild the conformance table for all the classes. This implies that
we need to reset the content of the melted_conformance_table.
We clear `sorter'.

Note and Improvements:
----------------------

We can merge CLASS_SORTER and TOPO_SORTER in one class


Degree 4:
---------

We check the validity of each changed generic classes. I.e. we check that the generic
parameter is not constraint to an anchored type or if the declaration itself does not
contain an anchored type, and that the name of the constraint is part of the surrounding
universe. When the constraint is also generic, we need to check the validity of the
declaration.

For each class of the controler we will do:
Execution of `execute' from PASS2_C:
1) We marked the class as non-reverse engineered.

2) If class marked as changed we mark `do_pass2' and insert it in `pass3_controler'
   and `pass4_controler'
   Otherwise `do_pass2' has the value of `changed2' of current class

3) If `do_pass2', we called `pass2' from INHERIT_TABLE.
a) Getting the current class, its ID, its cluster, its `is_supplier_status_modifier', its
   CLASS_INFO, and the parents list. We wipe out the content of Selected.
b) We compute the feature table:
   - We search for the feature table with the ID `a_class.id' in FEAT_TBL_SERVER,
     if we found it we call `update_table' on it.
   - `Update_table' check that all the elements of the table are valid, and remove the
      invalid one and put them in `removed_feature_ids'.
   - We prepare `inherited_features' by setting the ID
   - If it is a resumed compilation we do `update_table' on the feature table found
     in the TMP_FEAT_TBL_SERVER.
c) We take each parents which have been put in the correct order and we merge them into
   the current INHERIT_TABLE.
   - We `check_parents' of CLASS_C on `a_class' each time we call `merge'
   - We take the feature table of each parent, and for each entry we duplicate it and
     instantiate it (??). With the new feature_i we create a new INHERIT_INFO object
	 that we insert in the INHERIT_TABLE
d) We check validity1, this is for the renaming purpose.
   - Make sure that old_name is different from new_name
   - Make sure that old_name is a feature of the parent
   - If new_name is infixed make sure it has one argument and it is a function
   - If new_name is prefixed make sure it has no argument and it is a function.
e) We check twice for the renamings
f) Analyze
   - For each feature which are inherited we call `process' on them.
     This will check that we are not undefining a deferred, a once, an attribute or
	 a frozen feature.
	 Then we check that the redefinition are correct in `check_features' from INHERIT_FEAT.
	 We insert the feature in `adapatations' if it defines an inherited deferred feature,
	 otherwuse we put the `inherited_info' into Òrigin_table.
     
g) We check validity2, this is for the undefine/redefine/select/export clause.
   - Make sure that the redefined features exist in the parent.
   - Make sure that the selected features exist in the parent.
   - Make sure that the undefined features exist in the parent.
   - Make sure that the exported features exist in the parent.

h) If the class has been marked `changed' we clean `changed_features' of `a_class' and we
   analyze the class declarations. I.e. we create for each features a corresponding FEATURE_I
   by calling `feature_unit'.

4) Then if the `local_extra_check_list' does not have the current compiled class, we
   insert it, because we need to do some stuff at the end of degree 4.

5) We check the validity of the creation constraints, i.e. that the feature specified in
   the creation clause are part of the constrained class.

6) If the system has some expanded types, we do a check on all the system to be sure about
   the validity of the use of expanded type.

7) If the system support `code_replication' we do a single pass on all the compiled class
   of degree 4.


Note and improvements:
----------------------

1) Can we do a marking of all living features now and get rid of the Dead Code Removal part?
2) We can improve the remove of `update_table' called in 3-b)
3) We can maybe do only one call to `check_parents' from 3-c)
4) Are we sure to do twice `check_generics' in 3-e)


Between Degree 4 and 3:
-----------------------

Make sure that all the creation procedures of the ROOT_CLASS have 0 argument or 1 argument
of type ARRAY[STIRNG].

Notes:
------

We should not go through all the creation procedures of the root class, we just need to
take the `creation_name' from the Ace file and make sure it has the correct number of
arguments and it is a creation procedure.


Degree 3:
---------

We call `execute' of PASS3_C, which calls `pass3' of each CLASS_C which needs to be recompiled.
