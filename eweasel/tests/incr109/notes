After initial compilation, a BOOL_STRING is changed to a BIT_REF.
The compiler correctly detects and reports a VEEN error.  But when
the offending line is deleted and compilation is resumed, the
compiler dies during pass 3 on the class with the message "object
allocation: No more memory".

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
