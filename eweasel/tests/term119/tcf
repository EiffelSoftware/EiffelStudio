test_name 	remove-constraint-veen-die
test_description A generic class whose formal generic parameter G is constrained by STRING has a call to `n.count' where `n: G'.  After initial compilation, the generic constraint is removed.  When the system is recompiled, the compiler does not detect the newly introduced VEEN error and dies during degree 2 on the class.
