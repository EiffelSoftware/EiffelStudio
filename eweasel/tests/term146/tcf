test_name	missing-actual-generic-crash
test_description A generic type TEST1 which has 2 formals is used in a parent clause of TEST2 with only one formal generic. If the system is such that the TEST2 is topologically sorted after TEST4 which uses conformance of TEST2 against TEST5 then the compiler crashes because it should have reported a VTUG error first before trying to analyze classes at degree 4. As pointed out, the test is meaninful only if TEST2 is topologically sorted at the end, to do that we do a tricky inheritance hierarchy.
