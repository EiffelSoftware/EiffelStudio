		<heading><size>2</size>Prerequisites</heading>
		<paragraph>Before installing EiffelStudio 5.6, it is necessary to install X11 for Mac OS X and the X11 SDK. Both are available from the Apple web site at:
			<list ordered="false">
				<item><link><url>http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/</url><label>http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/</label></link></item>
				<item><link><url> http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/</url><label>http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/</label></link></item>
			</list>
			<paragraph>You also need to install the Apple Developer Tools available as part of Mac OS X.</paragraph>
		</paragraph>

		<heading><size>2</size>Installing the Free Edition</heading>
		<paragraph>After downloading the <bold>Eiffel56.dmg</bold> installation package, double click on it to mount the disk image. Then double click on the <bold>Eiffel56.mpkg</bold> file to launch the installation procedure. Follow the steps indicated in the dialogs to complete the installation.</paragraph>

		<heading><size>2</size>Installing the Enterprise Edition</heading>
		<paragraph>Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive. Open the CD-ROM contents and double click on the <bold>Eiffel56.mpkg</bold> file to launch the installation procedure. Follow the steps indicated in the dialogs to complete the installation.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Once installed you need to register EiffelStudio. First you need to make sure you have started the X server. Then open a terminal window and type the following commands:
			<code_block>export ISE_EIFFEL=/Developer/Applications/Eiffel56
export ISE_PLATFORM=macosx
cd $ISE_EIFFEL
sudo ./register</code_block>
		</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enter an administrative password and then a dialog asking for your <bold>Username</bold> and <bold>CD Key</bold> should appear as it does below:</paragraph><paragraph><alignment>center</alignment><image><url>../../images/installation/56/mac_setup.png</url><alt_text>Setup dialog</alt_text></image></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enter the information located inside the box that contains your copy of the EiffelStudio Enterprise Edition. Once the information is correct, the <bold>Register</bold> button will be enabled. Click <bold>Register</bold> to actually register EiffelStudio.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You now need to launch EiffelStudio to register your copy. Follow the instructions located in the <bold>Starting EiffelStudio</bold> section below. The first time you launch EiffelStudio, you will be asked for an activation key through the following dialog:</paragraph>
			<paragraph><alignment>center</alignment><image><url>../../images/installation/56/mac_registration.png</url><alt_text>Registration dialog</alt_text></image></paragraph>
			<paragraph>By clicking on the <link><url>http://activate.eiffel.com</url><label>http://activate.eiffel.com</label></link> URL, a new web browser will appear with the requested fields automatically filled in with the appropriate information. Simply click <bold>Activate</bold> and a new page with an activation code will appear. Copy and paste the activation code in the first field and the <bold>Activate</bold> button should be enabled to let you activate your copy.</paragraph><paragraph> You can activate your copy up to three times. Once you have reached this threshold and need to reinstall your copy, contact Eiffel Software to request one more activation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If no web broswer appears, it is most likely because Safari is not installed on your machine or is not in your path. Instead you should manually launch a new web browser and go to the page <link><url>http://activate.eiffel.com</url><label>http://activate.eiffel.com</label></link> and enter the information manually. Then follow the above instructions as if the browser had been properly launched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may receive the following dialog when launching EiffelStudio:</paragraph>
			<paragraph><alignment>center</alignment><image><url>../../images/installation/56/mac_registration_error.png</url><alt_text>Registration incomplete</alt_text></image></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This probably means that the <bold>register</bold> program was not launched or did not succeed in storing data to the following file <bold>/Developer/Applications/Eiffel54/install/limand/.ec_license</bold>. To solve this, rerun the <bold>register</bold> program with a user account that has permissions to write at <bold>/Developer/Applications/Eiffel54/install/limand</bold> and enter your <bold>Username</bold> and <bold>CD Key</bold>.</paragraph>
	

		<heading><size>2</size>Starting EiffelStudio</heading>
		<paragraph>Now everything should be properly installed and you should be able to run the compiler. You can now launch EiffelStudio from the Finder under <bold>/Developer/Applications/EiffelStudio 5.6</bold>. If you are a new user to EiffelStudio, we recommend that you follow <link><url>../../general/guided_tour/studio/index.xml</url><label>the guided tour</label></link>.</paragraph>
