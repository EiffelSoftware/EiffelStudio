<H1><A name=changes><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Appendix A –
Changes</FONT></A></H1>This appendix lists changes since the first public draft
of this document.
<H4><A name=chang018><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Changes in Draft 0.18
(13 July 2001)</FONT></A></H4>
<UL>
  <LI>Two new testcase groups, <TT>randomDouble</TT> and <TT>randomSingle</TT>,
  have been added.
  <LI>Minor corrections and clarifications have been made. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=chang020><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Changes in Draft 0.20
(25 September 2001)</FONT></A></H4>
<UL>
  <LI>The <TT>rounding</TT> testcase group now includes tests for the
  <B>ceiling</B> and <B>floor</B> modes. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=chang100><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Changes in Version 1.00
(21 November 2001)</FONT></A></H4>The specification has been enhanced to include
tests for extended value arithmetic (including subnormal values and values such
as <TT>NaN</TT> and <TT>Infinity</TT>). In particular:
<UL>
  <LI>A new <TT>version</TT> directive has been added to allow a formal version
  number to be indicated.
  <LI>A new <TT>extended</TT> directive controls the <I>extended-values</I>
  setting.
  <LI>Operands and results with extended values are now possible.
  <LI>A new operation, <TT>integer</TT> (round-to-integer) has been added.
  <LI>Three new testcase groups, <TT>extend</TT>, <TT>integer</TT>, and
  <TT>randomBound32</TT>, have been added. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=chang102><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Changes in Version 1.02
(30 November 2001)</FONT></A></H4>
<UL>
  <LI>A new operation, <TT>remaindernear</TT> (IEEE remainder) has been added,
  together with a testcase group of the same name.
  <LI>Some underflow and overflow exception results and conditions have been
  corrected. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=chang103><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Changes in Version 1.03
(20 March 2002)</FONT></A></H4>
<UL>
  <LI>Three new operations and testcase groups (<TT>abs</TT>, <TT>max</TT>, and
  <TT>min</TT>) have been added.
  <LI>Corrected the description of the <TT>maxexponent</TT> directive; a value
  of zero is permitted. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=chang201><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Changes in Version 2.01
(3 July 2002)</FONT></A></H4>This version marks a major update of the testcases
to match the new combined arithmetic specification. The underlying syntax,
<I>etc.</I>, of the testcases is unchanged, but specific changes include:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Each testcase group has been split into two groups, one with the
  <I>extended</I> directive set to 1 and the other with it set to 0.
  <LI>One new operation and (pair of) testcase groups (<TT>trim</TT>) has been
  added.
  <LI>The <TT>extended</TT> testcase group has been removed and its testcases
  incorporated into other groups. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=chang206><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Changes in Version 2.06
(1 September 2002)</FONT></A></H4>This version incorporates updates to testcases
for subnormal numbers (previous testcases included subnormals which were more
precise than allowed by IEEE 854), and also adds testcases for rounding
<B>to-number</B> conversions. The <TT>subnormal</TT> condition has been added,
and subnormal numbers may be rounded and/or inexact (in the latter case,
underflow is raised).
<P>In this document:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The <TT>subnormal</TT> condition has been added.
  <LI>The <TT>conversion&nbsp;underflow</TT> and
  <TT>conversion&nbsp;overflow</TT> conditions have been removed (these
  conditions now raise <TT>underflow</TT> or <TT>overflow</TT>, respectively).
  <LI>The operand to the <TT>toSci</TT> and <TT>toEng</TT> operations is now
  subject to rounding.
  <LI>Minor clarifications have been added. </LI></UL>
<H4><A name=chang209><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Changes in Version 2.09
(8 October 2002)</FONT></A></H4>
<UL>
  <LI>The <TT>normalize</TT> and <TT>squareroot</TT> operations and testcase
  groups have been added.
  <LI>Extended tests now admit unrounded long operands without input rounding;
  the Lost_digits condition can therefore only occur when <I>extended</I> is 0.
  <LI>Three cases in <TT>remaindernear.decTest</TT> which should have produced
  Division_impossible, but did not, have been corrected (and extra tests have
  been added). </LI></UL>
