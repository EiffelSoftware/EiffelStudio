	description: "[
		Due to a bug in the compiler sometime eventhough we should check pre/postconditions
		of a routine `f' in class C, we don't. To circumvent that, we know when this case
		happen and therefore we know which assertions are going to be checked or not. Knowing
		this enable us to display or to hide the breakpoint in the flat format which is consistent
		with our code generation.

		This happen in the following case:

			deferred class
				A
			feature
				f is
					require
						False
					deferred
					ensure
						False
					end
			end

			class B
			feature
				f is
					require
						True
					do
					ensure
						True
					end
			end

			class C
			inherit A B
			end

		In the context of C the flat of `f' is:

			f is
				require -- from A
					False
				require else -- from B
					True
				do
				ensure -- from A
					False
				ensure then -- from B
					True
				end

		However our code generation does not regenerate the code in the context of C,
		and we keep the definition of `f' from B. Therefore there is no way to check
		inherited assertions from A. So the flat will generate the following 
		breakable position which corresponds to our code generation:

			f is
				require -- from A
					False
				require else -- from B
		O			True
				do
				ensure -- from A
					False
				ensure then -- from B
		O			True
		O		end

		To find out this case, it is enough to look at the definition of body_index of `f' in C and 
		check if an inherited assertion as the same. If it does, it means that no new body have been
		added.
