			<P>
			<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application_chart.html">EV_APPLICATION</A> is the basis for every vision2 system.
			</P>

			<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B>It is not possible to create a vision2 component unless an application exists (query <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_environment_chart.html">EV_ENVIRONMENT</A>).</P>
			</P>
			You may inherit <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application_chart.html">EV_APPLICATION</A> or use it as a client in order to create your vision2
			application. A simple method of using <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application_chart.html">EV_APPLICATION</A> is as follows:
				<OL>
					<LI>create an instance of <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application_chart.html">EV_APPLICATION</A>.
					<LI>create one or more windows for your application.
					<LI>launch the application.
				</OL>
			<P>
			<H2>Launching the application</H2>
			In vision2, to launch an application means to pass control to the underlying operating system. Simply creating an application does not launch it. An explicit call to <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html#f_launch">launch</A> is required
			for the processing to begin.
			<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B>A vision2 system is an event based system. This means that you do not have control of the execution within a vision2 system, but must respond appropriately to <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/events/index.html">events</A> as they occur. Therefore, if you call launch on
			an <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application_chart.html">EV_APPLICATION</A>, the processing for the application will continue indefinitely unless you have provided a means to exit the application. It is essential to initialize your components
			correctly, so your application can be exited (call <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html#f_destroy">destroy</A> on the application).
			</P>
			<H2>General features</H2>
			<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application_chart.html">EV_APPLICATION</A> contains features for querying and setting attributes globaly to a vision2 system. Some of these commonly used features are detailed below:
			<UL>
				<LI><A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html#f_windows">windows</A> is a list of all the objects of type <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_window_chart.html">EV_WINDOW</A> currently
				in the system.
				<LI><A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html#f_focused_widget">focused_widget</A> is the current widget within the application that has the focus. This may be Void.
				<LI><A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html#f_ctrl_pressed">ctrl_pressed</A>, <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html#f_alt_pressed">alt_pressed</A> and <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html#f_shift_pressed">shift_pressed</A> provide
				a means to query the current state of these keyboard modifiers.
				<LI><A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/kernel/ev_application.html#f_clipboard">clipboard</A> provides access to the operating system clipboard through an object of type <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/kernel/ev_clipboard.html">EV_CLIPBOARD</A>.
