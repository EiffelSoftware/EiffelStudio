test_name 	 none-then-string-generic
test_description A class has a feature of type `HASH_TABLE [STRING, NONE]'.  After the compiler correctly detects a VUAR error, NONE is changed to STRING, thereby making the class correct.  When compilation is resumed, the compiler dies with a segmentation fault during degree -1 on HASH_TABLE.
