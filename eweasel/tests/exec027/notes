A system which allocates a number of fairly large strings (approx 0.4
MB each) and calls routines allocate_tiny, full_collect and
full_coalesce in class MEMORY compiles fine. When the system is
executed it eventually runs out of memory, which appears to indicate a
memory leak.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
