ISE EiffelStore 4.3e, July 1998.

Overview
========

   The EiffelStore library provides a consistent set of 
classes for writing object oriented Eiffel applications that need 
to handle persistent objects.
   EiffelStore 4.3e has currently only been tested with:
		ISE-Eiffel Release 4.3e
   		Oracle8 8.0.3
		Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise for Windows NT Evaluation Copy
 Version 11.5
		IngresII
		ODBC 3.0

Bug fixed
=========
 
  Many previous bugs were linked to multithreaded running 
of databases such as Oracle, Sybase or Ingres. It is now fixed, since 
in every ISE EiffelBench 4.3, a multithreaded application can be found.

  There were plenty bugs regarding the use of stored procedure, only for  
Ingres and Sybase, since it was not implemented either in the Oracle handle 
or in the ODBC handle. For instance, using Ingres, due to new release, 
the execution sql statement was obsolete.

  Generaly, bugs were caused by new release changes.

New functionalities
===================

  All databases support stored procedure manipulation. 

  There are two new classes, DB_DYN_CHANGE and DB_DYN_SELECTION 
that are useful for any dynamic sql transaction. Dynamic sql has been tested 
with Oracle8 and ODBC.

  
Internal changes
================

  If you ever had a look into the EiffelStore library, you will see that 
there is an architecture modification. There is no more effective classes for each 
handle. Now instead of using the inheritance for retrieving handle specifications, 
we are using the genericity. Therefore, for each handle there is only one 
specification file of the name of the database (one instead of 26 files).
  The pros of using genericity is gain of execution speed, gain of space (less created objects).
All the specific classes, ORACLE, INGRES, ODBC and SYBASE inherit from the DATABASE class,
which is deffered. This way it is easier to add a new handle to EiffelStore.

  The use of the date and the time is now done by the EiffelTime library.

  The Oracle and ODBC handles support all stored procedure manipulations.
