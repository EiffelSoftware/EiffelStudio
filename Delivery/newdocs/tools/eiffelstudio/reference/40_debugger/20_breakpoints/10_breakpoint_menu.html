<h1>Breakpoint menu</h1>
<p>In all flat forms (HYPERLINK(feature flat form) feature flat form and
HYPERLINK(class flat form) class flat form), a margin is displayed on the left
of the editor. <A HREF="00_introduction.html">Breakpoints</a> are there symbolized as circles, of a different
appearance depending on their state: enabled ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbench/icon_bpenabled.gif"> ), disabled 
( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbench/icon_bpdisabled.gif"> ), or not set 
( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbench/icon_bpslot.gif"> ).<p>Right-clicking on any
breakpoint pops up a context menu:<p>SCREENSHOT(breakpoint context menu)<p>Clicking
one of the three first entries of the context menu changes the state of the
breakpoint that was right-clicked. The last entry (<b>Run to breakpoint</b>)
launches the debugged application so that it will stop as soon as the selected
breakpoint is encountered, as if the breakpoint had been enabled.
