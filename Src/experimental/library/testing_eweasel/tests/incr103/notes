After initial compilation, a class is changed to an expanded class.
The compiler detects the newly introduced VDRD(2) violation.  Then an
invalid creation instruction is added and the compiler reports the
VGCC error.  But when the invalid creation instruction is removed, the
compiler accepts the classes even though the VDRD(2) error is still present.

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
