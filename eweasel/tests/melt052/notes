A class calls a feature that is a once function in another class,
where the target of the call is a creation expression.  The once
function value is stated not be Void in the invariant of the second
class.  If the system is melted, execution ends with an invariant
violation.  Frozen code works correctly.

Discovered in release 5.2.0928.
