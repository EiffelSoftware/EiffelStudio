<h1>
Looking for a class</h1>
There are two simple ways to find a class if you know its name or a part
of it :
<ul>&nbsp;
<li>
You may use the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/20_cluster_tool/00_introduction.html">cluster
tool</a>. This tool presents the entire universe of your project. By developing
the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/20_cluster_tool/10_cluster_tree.html">cluster
tree</a>, you will be able to find what you are looking for. This method
is quick if you already have an idea of where the class is in the universe.</li>

<li>
Using <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/10_address_bars/00_introduction.html">address
bars</a> will be quicker if you do not have this information or if the
size of your project is important. If you type the name of the searched
class (you can use wildcards, i.e. "*" and "?") in the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/10_address_bars/10_main_address_bar.html">main
address bar</a> - and then select the right class in the displayed list
if there are several possibilities - the editor will be centered on the
class you are looking for. The information about the class location will
be displayed in the title bar of the window. If you need more complete
information about the class location, you can <a href="../../../reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">pick</a>
the name of the class in the editor and drop it on the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/20_cluster_tool/40_locate_command.html">view
icon</a>&nbsp;<img SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_view_small_color.gif" >
of the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/20_cluster_tool/00_introduction.html">cluster
tool</a>. This tool will then show where the class is in the universe.</li>
</ul>
