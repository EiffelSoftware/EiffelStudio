	description: "[
		Duplication (conceptual) and actual duplication (code duplication is handled here).
		Each line of the ORIGIN_TABLE is processes separately.
		Each line correponds to a routine id, in other words, each line represents one
		routine (the notion of routine corresponds to a feature introduced into a class
		without ant predecessors, and all its evolutions throughout the various inheritance
		adaptations and branches).

		Before repeated inheritance was implemented, the routine `compute_feature_table'
		performed the following operations:
		1) For each line pick one FEATURE_I that would be the selected one.
		1.a) If the FEATURE_I's all have the same body id, the first feature is chosen
			arbritrarily
		1.b) Otherwise, go through the parent clauses and find the selection. If several
			selections ---> VMRC2, otherwise insert the selected name into the global
			"Selected" string list. Unselect the other FEATURE_I's, i.e. compute a new routine
			id set for them (one element) and insert them as new routines into the SELECT_TABLE
		1.c) If nothing found ---> VMRC3
		Modifications for correct implementation of the semantics of repeated inheritance:
