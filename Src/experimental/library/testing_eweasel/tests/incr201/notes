A generic class has a formal generic parameter constrained by a
nonexistent and invalid creation procedure `infix "@"'.  The compiler
correctly reports VTCG error.  Then a syntax error is added to the
class.  The compiler detects the error, but says "Exception occurred
while displaying error message" when it tries to print the name of the
class.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
