A class has a routine which repeatedly applies the `strip' operator to
the current object and puts the resulting array in a local variable.
The class has 4 INTEGER attributes.  Executing the system results in a
run-time panic.  Reducing the number of attributes to 3 or turning off
garbage collection allows the system to execute correctly for a huge
number of iterations.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
