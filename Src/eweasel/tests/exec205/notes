A class has a routine which has 1000 instructions, each of which
is `a := << 1 >>'.  The system compiles fine when frozen and the C code
compiles (as long as one doesn't use the -O option).  When the
system is executed, it dies with an "out of locals" run-time
panic.

Discovered in some ancient release.
