A system has a class that inherits a deferred feature `value', which
is of type string, and effects it with a string constant.  After
initial compilation, the effecting feature name is changed,
introducing a VCCH(1) error.  When compiler reports the error, feature
is changed back to `value' and compilation finishes.  But when the
system is then frozen, the compiler dies with a segmentation fault in
`real_body_id'.

Discovered in release 5.2.0914.
