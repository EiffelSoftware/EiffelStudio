test_name 	 deep-clone-frozen-not-equal
test_description A class has pattern of creation of small STRINGs guided by a random number generator.  It also has an attribute which is a BIT_REF and it calls deep_clone on the current object after each STRING creation. The system compiles fine when frozen with `assertion (all)', but violates postcondition `deep_equal' of routine `deep_clone' when it is executed.  Melted code seems to work fine.
