The following are OK, but test needs to be fixed (I haven't figure out
how to fix it yet).

	remove-part-of-external-decl

The following test failure seems to be due to a change in what will
be accepted in the Ace file.  Can you explain this change?

	lace-bogus-gen-lang

The following passed on 4.5 but do not pass in 5.0.001 due to changes in
the way compiler looks for changes to the file system.  These are
incrementality bugs in the sense that the error (or lack of error)
the compiler reports after an incremental change is different than
the result obtained by re-compiling from scratch.

The following test causes the compiler to go into an infinite loop.
It would be really nice if it could be fixed since it is the only
known case of a compiler infinite loop (at least, the only case I
know of).

	validity-vlec1-other-generic

The following passed at one time (on some platform and compiler version)
but now do not pass.  They did not pass in version 4.5 either.

	illegal-attributes	Variables like x(): STRING
				Constants like x(): INTEGER is 13

	string-to-bit1		Change constant STRING to BIT 1, recompile
				System execution fails.
