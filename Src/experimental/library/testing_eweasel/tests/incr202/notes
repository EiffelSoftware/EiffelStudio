A system has a root class which explicitly names `default_create' as
creation procedure and redefines `default_create' to print something.
The Ace file specifies the root class, but does not specify a creation
procedure.  After initial compilation where the system is melted,
system execution correctly calls the redefined default_create.  But
when the system is finalized with no changes, the finalized system
produces no output and the redefined `default_create' has been removed
by dead code removal.

Discovered in Release 5.4.0403.
