		<H1>Abstract Container Structures: The Taxonomy</H1>
			<P>
				A container data structure (or container in the sequel) is an object which serves
				to store and access collections of objects, called the <B>items</B> of the
				container. All classes describing containers are descendants of the deferred
				class <A HREF="..\..\Reference\access\container.html">CONTAINER</A>.<BR>
				A container can be studied from three viewpoints: access, storage and traversal.<BR>
				The <B>access</B> criterion affects how the clients of a container can access its items. For
				example, in a stack or queue, only one item is accessible at any given time, and
				clients do not choose that item; in contrast, clients of an array or hash table must
				provide an index, or more generally a key, to access an item.<BR>
				The <B>storage</B> criterion affects how the items are put together. For example some
				containers are finite, others potentially infinite; among finite structures, some are
				bounded, others unbounded.<BR>
				The traversal criterion affects how, if in any way, the items of a container can be
				traversed. A traversal is a mechanism which makes it possible to examine each
				item of a container once, in a clearly specified order. For example some containers
				can be traversed sequentially, in one direction or two; tree structures lend themselves
				to preorder, postorder and breadth-first traversals.<BR>
				For each of these criteria the Base library offers a single-inheritance hierarchy of
				deferred classes. The top of the access hierarchy is class
				<A HREF="..\Reference\structures\access\collection.html">COLLECTION</A>;
				the top of the storage hierarchy is class
				<A HREF="..\Reference\structures\storage\box.html">BOX</A>; the top of the
				traversal hierarchy is class
				<A HREF="..\Reference\structures\traversing\traversable.html">TRAVERSABLE</A>.
				These three classes are heirs of the most general class,
				<A HREF="..\..\Reference\access\container.html">CONTAINER</A>.
