After initial compilation, an external routine which is "C inline" has
the order of its formal arguments changed.  When changes are melted,
system execution produces the wrong output (same output as before).
Looks like the compiler needs to freeze when any changes are made to
the list of formal argument names.

Discovered in release 5.4.0515.
