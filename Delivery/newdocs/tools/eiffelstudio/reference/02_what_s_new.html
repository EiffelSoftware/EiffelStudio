		<H1>What's new in EiffelStudio 5.2</H1>
		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>More improvements in usability and bug fixes.</li>
          <li>Added a status bar, which gives a lot of information, such as the
            state of the compilation or the name of the current project.</li>
          <li>Clicking feature clauses in the feature tree now centers the
            editor on the selected feature clause.</li>
          <li>More specific icons in the feature and cluster trees, so that
            identifying deferred classes and the nature of features is now
            straightforward.</li>
          <li>Up to 10 external commands can now be defined and called from the <b>Tools</b>
            menu.</li>
          <li>The new <b>Quick compile</b> command lets you recompile only the
            classes that have been edited in EiffelStudio, skipping the
            sometimes tedious degree 6, that looks for modified classes.</li>
          <li>Control picking now has a configurable effect.</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Debugger</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Expressions can now be dynamically evaluated in the debugger.</li>
          <li>Conditional breakpoints.</li>
          <li>Objects can now define a string representation that is displayed
            in the debugger, to see their state at a glance.</li>
          <li>Possible stack overflows can now be detected in the debugger
            before they occur.</li>
          <li>Classes can now define a `debug_output' feature, whose string
            result is automatically displayed in the debugger for all objects of
            that type.</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Compiler and .NET</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click
          <a href="30_compiler/60_version_history/01_51_release/00_50_to_51_changes.html">
          here</a> for more details on compiler improvements and full Eiffel 
          support on .NET</li>

		<H1>What was new in EiffelStudio 5.1</H1>
		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Numerous improvements in usability and bug fixes.</li>
          <li>Richer class and cluster creation dialogs.</li>
          <li>Class name completion in the editor (by pressing Shift+Ctrl+Space
            half-way through the class name).</li>
          <li>Editor now supports drag-and-drop of the selection.</li>
          <li>When debugging a project from EiffelStudio, the current directory 
          will be your project directory. It is a change from previous version 
          where:<ul>
          <li>on Windows, it used to be launched in the EIFGEN\W_code of your 
          project directory</li>
          <li>on Unix, it used to be launched from the same directory where 
          `estudio' (or `ebench') was launched.</li>
        </ul>
		  </li>
          <li>EiffelStudio GUI now also available on Unix platforms and Windows 9x/Me</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Compiler and .NET</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click
          <a href="30_compiler/60_version_history/01_51_release/00_50_to_51_changes.html">
          here</a> for more details on compiler improvements and full Eiffel 
          support on .NET</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Libraries</h2>
		<h3>EiffelBase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is now forbidden to create a <span class="eclass">BIT_REF</span> or a <span class="eclass">BIT X</span> object using 
          its creation procedure (before it was accepted but did not work)</li>
          <li>Added <span class="efeature">make_temporary_name</span> in <span class="eclass">FILE_NAME</span></li>
          <li>Made <span class="efeature">to_c</span> obsolete from class <span class="eclass">INTEGER_INTERVAL</span></li>
          <li>Changed semantic of <span class="efeature">split</span> from class <span class="eclass">STRING</span></li>
          <li>Fixed a bug in <span class="efeature">clear_all</span> from <span class="eclass">HASH_TABLE</span> that 
          kept a reference to the last found item. Now it does not keep the 
          reference after a call to <span class="efeature">clear_all</span>.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Vision2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Support for Vision2 applications on GTK platforms.</li>
          <li>Some changes in the Vision2 library have been made,
          <a href="../../../libraries/vision2/content/0-_revisions/index.html">

		<H1>What was new in EiffelStudio 5.0</H1>
        <h2>Graphical environment</h2>
        
        <UL>
        <LI>New Look and feel.
        
        <LI>New way of starting EiffelStudio and simplified the process of compiling
        an existing project.
        
        <LI>New editor with:
        <UL>
	<LI>smart syntax highlighting
	<LI>feature completion (by pressing Ctrl+Space after an identifier).
	<LI>syntax completion of major control statement (if, from, is,...) and of symbols such as `{', `[', `(', `&quot;',...
	<LI>smart autoindenting
	<LI>block indent and exdent.
	<LI>infinite level of Undo/Redo
	</UL>
        
        <LI>When edition a class text which has been successfully compiled, the class
        will be fully `pick-and-dropable'.
        
        <LI>Faster rendering for Clickable, Flat, Contract (previously known as Short) and Flat Contract views.
        
        <LI>System tool has been replaced by a `project settings' window. The underlying mechanism of the Ace file is kept, but all changes are
        done through a nice GUI making it simpler for beginners to create their first Ace file.
        
        <LI>Toolbars are now customizable
        
        <LI>EiffelCase has been merged within EiffelStudio to provide a true reverse
        engineering using the BON notation.
        </UL>
        
        
        <H2>Compiler</H2>
        
        The compiler has been improved in many ways and some functionality have
        been added. <a href="30_compiler/60_version_history/00_50_release/00_45_to_50_changes.html">Check
        it out</a>.
        
        
        <H2>Debugger</H2>
        
        <UL>
        <LI>New debugger functionalities:
        <UL>
  <LI>one can step-in, step-out, step-by-step when they want to.
  <LI>one can put a breakpoint on the fly (Windows Only)
  <LI>one can see all local variables and arguments.
  <LI>one can set breakpoints in all kind of assertion clauses except in invariants.
  </UL>
  <LI>Debugging is faster.
  </UL>
        
        
        <H2> Documentation</H2>
        
        <UL>
        <LI>New documentation generation (limited now to HTML) which is completely clickable as
          if within EiffelStudio. It also
        includes an EiffelCase-like documentation generation.
        
        <LI>Generation of XMI which can be used in tools such as Rational Rose.
        </UL>
        
        
        <H2> Libraries</H2>
        <h3>EiffelBase:</H3>
        
        <UL>
        <LI>No more GENERAL class as proposed by the NICE comittee. It has been replaced by ANY which does not inherit
          any more from PLATFORM.
        
        <LI>Adaptation of the ARRAY class to the ELKS 2000 standard.
        
        <LI>This implies a change in our CONTAINER class where we renamed `empty' into
        `is_empty' and made `empty' obsolete. If you were inheriting from CONTAINER
        and redefining `empty', make sure to update your code so that you redefine
        `is_empty' instead. That way your polymorphic calls will still work as expected without having to change all call to `empty' into calls to
        `is_empty'.
        
        <LI>New implementation of `is_equal' on LIST which will now check that two
        lists are identical if their items are identical.
        
        <LI>New implementation of `copy' on LIST.
        
        <LI>New implementation of an iterative `is_equal' on TREE which will now check
        that two trees are identical if their items are identical.
        
        <LI>New implementation of an iterative `copy' on TREE, which recursively
          copies the tree.
        
        <LI>New ROUTINE classes which perform better type checking on argument passing.
        
        <LI>Introduction of binary operations on INTEGER types:
	`&amp;', `|', `bit_xor', `bit_not', `bit_shift', `|>>', `|&lt;&lt;' and bit_text.
        
        <LI>Removed `infix "^"' from NUMERIC. It does not break any inheritance, but
        break clients that were using this operator on an entity declared of type NUMERIC. This is due to the different return type of this operator
        depending the NUMERIC type you are handling.
        
        <LI>Changed the signature of `pruned' in BINARY_SEARCH_TREE to take an extra
        argument. This was necessary to fix a problem that caused the `parent' attributes to become inconsistent under certain
        conditions when calling `pruned'.
        
        <LI>Reimplemented the features `disjoint' and `symdif' of SUBSET. These features caused problems under certain conditions and
        were also quite inefficient. The new implementation of these features uses the strategy pattern to choose among different versions of
        these calculations depending on the properties of the elements contained in the set.
        
        <LI>All features on SUBSET that take another subset as an argument (e.g. `intersect') now accept any other subset type as an argument,
        independent of its underlying implementation, and not only subsets of type
        `like Current'.
        
        <LI>Many smaller bugfixes for bugs that were reported by our customers
          or that have been discovered during our development and testing.
        </UL>
        
        <h3> WEL:</H3>
        <p>
        
		Modified classes relative to the use of registry keys to be written only using
        Eiffel and externals to Win32 API (no more C intermediates). In the process
        `close_key' and `delete_key' are now commands and not queries. To find out
        if it their call was successful, you can query `last_call_successful'.</p>
