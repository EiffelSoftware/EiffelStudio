After initial compilation, the name of the single creation procedure
is removed from the creation clause, leaving it empty.  When the
system is recompiled, the compiler detects the VD27 violation.  Then
the creation procedure name is added back but twice, resulting in
`creation make, make'.  The compiler detects the VGCP(3) error but
dies with an internal error trying to report it.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
