		<paragraph>We now look at the overall organization of Eiffel software.  </paragraph>
		<paragraph>References to  Eiffel Software -originated libraries appearing in subsequent examples include: 
			<bold>EiffelBase</bold>, the fundamental open-source library covering data structures and algorithms; the 
			<bold>kernel library</bold>, a subset of EiffelBase covering the most basic notions such as arrays and strings; and 
			<bold>EiffelVision 2</bold>, an advanced graphics and GUI library providing full compatibility across platforms (Unix, Windows, VMS) with native look-and-feel on each.

		</heading>
		<paragraph>An Eiffel system is a collection of classes, one of which is designated as the root class.  One of the features of the root class, which must be one of its creation procedures, is designated as the root procedure.  </paragraph>
		<paragraph>To execute such a system is to create an instance of the root class (an object created according to the class description) and to execute the root procedure.  In anything more significant than "Hello World" systems, this will create new objects and apply features to them, in turn triggering further creations and feature calls.  </paragraph>
		<paragraph>For the system to make sense, it must contains all the classes on which the root 
			<bold>depends</bold> directly or indirectly.  A class 
			<code>
				<class_name>B</class_name>
			</code> depends on a class 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code> if it is either a 
			<bold>client</bold> of 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code>, that is to say uses objects of type 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code>, or an 
			<bold>heir</bold> of 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code>, that is to say extends or specializes 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code>.  (These two relations, client and inheritance, are covered below.)

			<content>Classes</content>
		</heading>
		<paragraph>The notion of class is central to the Eiffel approach.  A class is the description of a type of run-time data structures (objects), characterized by common operations 
			features) and properties.  Examples of classes include:
		</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
			<item>In a banking system, a class 
				<code>
					<class_name>ACCOUNT</class_name>
				</code> may have features such as 
				<code>
					<feature_name>deposit</feature_name>
				</code>, adding a certain amount to an account, 
				<code>
					<feature_name>all_deposits</feature_name>
				</code>, yielding the list of deposits since the account's opening, and 
				<code>
					<feature_name>balance</feature_name>
				</code>, yielding the current balance, with properties stating that 
				<code>
					<feature_name>deposit</feature_name>
				</code> must add an element to the 
				<code>
					<feature_name>all_deposits</feature_name>
				</code> list and update 
				<code>
					<feature_name>balance</feature_name>
				</code> by adding the sum deposited, and that the current value of 
				<code>
					<feature_name>balance</feature_name>
				</code> must be consistent with the lists of deposits and withdrawals.
			</item>
			<item> A class 
				<code>
					<class_name>COMMAND</class_name>
				</code> in an interactive system of any kind may have features such as 
				<code>
					<feature_name>execute</feature_name>
				</code> and 
				<code>
					<feature_name>undo</feature_name>
				</code> , as well as a feature 
				<code>
					<feature_name>undoable</feature_name>
				</code> which indicates whether a command can be undone, with the property that 
				<code>
					<feature_name>undo</feature_name>
				</code> is only applicable if 
				<code>
					<feature_name>undoable</feature_name>
				</code> yields the value true.
			</item>
			<item> A class 
				<code>
					<class_name>LINKED_LIST</class_name>
				</code> may have features such as 
				<code>
					<feature_name>put</feature_name>
				</code>, which adds an element to a list, and 
				<code>
					<feature_name>count</feature_name>
				</code>, yielding the number of elements in the list, with properties stating that 
				<code>
					<feature_name>put</feature_name>
				</code> increases 
				<code>
					<feature_name>count</feature_name>
				</code> by one and that 
				<code>
					<feature_name>count</feature_name>
				</code> is always non-negative.
			</item>
		</list>
		<paragraph>We may characterize the first of these examples as an analysis class, directly modeling objects from the application domain; the second one as a design class, describing a high-level solution; and the third as an implementation class, reused whenever possible from a library such as EiffelBase.  In Eiffel, however, there is no strict distinction between these categories; it is part of the approaches seamlessness that the same notion of class, and the associated concepts, may be used at all levels of the software development process.  </paragraph>

			<content>Class relations</content>
		</heading>
		<paragraph>Two relations may exist between classes:</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
			<item> You can define a class 
				<code>
					<class_name>C</class_name>
				</code> as a 
				<bold>client</bold> of a class 
				<code>
					<class_name>A</class_name>
				</code> to enable the features of 
				<code>
					<class_name>C</class_name>
				</code> to rely on objects of type 
				<code>
					<class_name>A</class_name>
				</code>.
			</item>
			<item> You may define a class 
				<code>
					<class_name>B</class_name>
				</code> as an 
				<bold>heir</bold> of a class 
				<code>
					<class_name>A</class_name>
				</code> to provide 
				<code>
					<class_name>B</class_name>
				</code> with all the features and properties of 
				<code>
					<class_name>A</class_name>
				</code>, letting 
				<code>
					<class_name>B</class_name>
				</code> add its own features and properties and modify some of the inherited features if appropriate.
			</item>
		</list>
		<paragraph>If 
			<code>
				<class_name>C</class_name>
			</code> is a client of 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code>, 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code> is a 
			<bold>supplier</bold> of 
			<code>
				<class_name>C</class_name>
			</code>.  If 
			<code>
				<class_name>B</class_name>
			</code> is an heir of 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code>, 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code> is a 
			<bold>parent</bold> of 
			<code>
				<class_name>B</class_name>
			</code>.  A 
			<bold>descendant</bold> of 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code> is either 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code> itself or, recursively, a descendant of an heir of 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code>; in more informal terms a descendant is a direct or indirect heir, or the class itself.  To exclude 
			<code>
				<class_name>A</class_name>
			</code> itself we talk of 
			<bold>proper descendant</bold>.  In the reverse direction the terms are 
			<bold>ancestor</bold> and 
			<bold>proper ancestor</bold>.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The client relation can be cyclic; an example involving a cycle would be classes 
			<code>
				<class_name>PERSON</class_name>
			</code> and 
			<code>
				<class_name>HOUSE</class_name>
			</code>, modeling the corresponding informal everyday "object" types and expressing the properties that every person has a home and every home has an architect.  The inheritance (heir) relation may not include any cycle.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>In modeling terms, client roughly represents the relation "has" and heir roughly represents "is".  For example we may use Eiffel classes to model a certain system and express that every child 
			<code>
				<feature_name>has</feature_name>
			</code> a birth date (client relation) and is a person (inheritance).
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Distinctive of Eiffel is the rule that lasses can only be connected through these two relations.  This excludes the behind-the-scenes dependencies often found in other approaches, such as the use of global variables, which jeopardize the modularity of a system.  Only through a strict policy of limited and explicit inter-class relations can we achieve the goals of reusability and extendibility.  </paragraph>

			<content>The global inheritance structure</content>
		</heading>
		<paragraph>An Eiffel class that you write does not come into a vacuum but fits in a preordained structure, shown in the figure and involving two library classes: 
			<code>
				<class_name>ANY</class_name>
			</code> and 
			<code>
				<class_name>NONE</class_name>
			</code>.
		</paragraph>
		<image>
			<url>tutorial-4.png</url>
		</image>
		<paragraph>Any class that does not explicitly inherit from another is considered to inherit from 
			<code>
				<class_name>ANY</class_name>
			</code>, so that every class is a descendant, direct or indirect, of 
			<code>
				<class_name>ANY</class_name>
			</code>. 
			<code>
				<class_name>ANY</class_name>
			</code> introduces a number of general-purpose features useful everywhere, such as copying, cloning and equality testing operations (page 
			<link>
				<url>tutorial-07.xml</url><anchor_name>12485</anchor_name>
				<label>28</label>
			</link>) and default input-output.  The procedure 
			<code>
				<string>print</string>
			</code> used in the first version of our "Hello World" (page 
			<link>
				<url>tutorial-05.xml</url><anchor_name>80381</anchor_name>
				<label>11</label>
			</link>) comes from 
			<code>
				<class_name>ANY</class_name>
			</code>.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			<code>
				<class_name>NONE</class_name>
			</code> inherits from any class that has no explicit heir.  Since inheritance has no cycles, 
			<code>
				<class_name>NONE</class_name>
			</code> cannot have proper descendants.  This makes it useful, as we will see, to specify non-exported features, and to denote the type of void values.  Unlike 
			<code>
				<class_name>ANY</class_name>
			</code>, class 
			<code>
				<class_name>NONE</class_name>
			</code> doesn't have an actual class text; instead, it's a convenient fiction.

			<content>Clusters</content>
		</heading>
		<paragraph>Classes are the only form of module in Eiffel.  As will be explained in more detail, they also provide the basis for the only form of type.  This module-type identification is at the heart of object technology and of the fundamental simplicity of the Eiffel method.  </paragraph>
		<paragraph>Above classes, you will find the concept of cluster.  A cluster is a group of related classes.  Clusters are a property of the method, enabling managers to organize the development into teams.  As we have already seen (section 
			<link>
				<url>tutorial-04.xml</url><anchor_name>41726</anchor_name>
				<label>3</label>
			</link>) they also play a central role in the lifecycle model.  Clusters are an organizational concept, not a form of module, and do not require an Eiffel language construct.
		</paragraph>
		<heading>
			<size>2</size>
			<content>External software</content>
		</heading>
		<paragraph>The subsequent sections will show how to write Eiffel classes with their features.  In an Eiffel system, however, not everything has to be written in Eiffel: some features may be 
			<bold>external</bold> , coming from languages such as C, C++, Java, C# Fortran and others.  For example a feature declaration may appear (in lieu of the forms seen later) as
		</paragraph>
		<code_block>
<feature_name>file_status</feature_name> (<local_variable>filedesc</local_variable>: <class_name>INTEGER</class_name>): <class_name>INTEGER </class_name><keyword>is</keyword>
        <comment>-- Status indicator for filedesc</comment>
     <keyword>external</keyword>
         <string>"C"</string> <keyword>alias</keyword>  <string>"_fstat"</string>
     <keyword>end</keyword>
</code_block>
		<paragraph>to indicate that it is actually an encapsulation of a C function whose original name is 
			<code>
				<feature_name>fstat _</feature_name>
			</code>.  The 
			<code>
				<keyword>alias</keyword>
			</code> clause is optional, but here it is needed because the C name, starting with an underscore, is not valid as an Eiffel identifier.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Similar syntax exists to interface with C++ classes.   Eiffel Software  Eiffel includes a tool called 
			Legacy++ which will automatically produce, from a C++ class, an Eiffel class that encapsulates its facilities, making them available to the rest of the Eiffel software as 
			bona fide  Eiffel features.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>These mechanisms illustrate one of the roles of Eiffel: as an system architecturing and software composition tool, used at the highest level to produce systems with robust, flexible structures ready for extendibility, reusability and maintainability.  In these structures not everything must be written in the Eiffel language: existing software elements and library components can play their part, with the structuring capabilities of Eiffel (classes, information hiding, inheritance, clusters, contracts and other techniques seen in this presentation) serving as the overall wrapping mechanism.  </paragraph>
