A class has a routine which prints `t.count' where `t' is of type
`expanded LINKED_LIST [like Current]'.  The root class, which is
expanded, inherits this routine and makes it a creation procedure.  If
the system is melted, execution dies with a segmentation fault.
Frozen code works fine.

Discovered in release 5.4.0610.
