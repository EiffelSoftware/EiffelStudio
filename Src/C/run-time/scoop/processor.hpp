doc:	<struct name="rt_processor" export="shared">
doc:		<summary> The SCOOP logical unit of processing.
doc:
doc:			The processor is responsible for receiving calls, executing them,
doc: 			and notifying clients of possible changes to wait conditions.
doc:		</summary>
doc:		<field name="cache" type="struct queue_cache"> A cache of private queues to other processors. These are used to log calls when the current processor is a client. </field>
doc:		<field name="queue_of_queues" type="struct rt_message_channel"> The queue of queues of this processors.
doc:			This will be used by client processors to add new private queues for this processor to work on.
doc:			Clients can only send SCOOP_MESSAGE_ADD_QUEUE on this channel, and the GC can only send SCOOP_MESSAGE_SHUTDOWN.
doc:			NOTE: Clients must synchronize access to this field with the queue_of_queues_mutex, as the message channel struct is not safe to be used by multiple senders. </field>
doc:		<field name="queue_of_queues_mutex", type="EIF_MUTEX_TYPE*"> The mutex used to protect the queue_of_queues field. </field>
doc:		<field name="result_notify" type="struct rt_message_channel"> A notification channel for the processor to wait on when it waits for the result of a synchronous call. </field>
doc:		<field name="startup_notify" type="struct rt_message_channel"> A notification channel to inform the constructing thread that the new processor has successfully spawned. </field>

doc:		<field name="wait_condition" type="EIF_COND_TYPE*"> A condition variable for wait condition change signalling.
doc:			The client (the current processor) will wait on this CV, whereas any suppliers will send signals to it. </field>
doc:		<field name="wait_condition_mutex" type="EIF_MUTEX_TYPE*"> The mutex used in conjunction with the wait_condition CV. </field>
doc:		<field name="wait_condition_subscribers" type="struct subscriber_list_t (a vector of struct rt_processor*)"> The list of clients that registered for a wait condition change signal. </field>

doc:		<field name="request_group_stack" type="struct request_group_stack_t (a vector of struct rt_request_group)">
doc:			A stack of request groups for this processor. The stack mirrors the processors locked in the real call stack. </field>
doc:		<field name="generated_private_queues" type="struct private_queue_list_t (a vector of struct rt_private_queue*)">
doc:			The queues generated by this processor (i.e. with the current processor as the queue's supplier). Each processor is responsible for 'his' queues during GC and cleanup. </field>
doc:		<field name="generated_private_queues_mutex" type="EIF_MUTEX_TYPE*"> The mutex used to protect the generated_private_queues vector. This is necessary because many clients may access the vector to create new queues. </field>

doc:		<field name="current_msg" type="struct rt_message"> The call that this processor is currently working on. This will be traced during GC marking. </field>
doc:		<field name="pid" type="EIF_SCP_PID"> The unique logical ID of the current processor. </field>
doc:		<field name="has_client" type="EIF_BOOLEAN"> Stores whether the processor has a client. This is used to prevent that an active processor, that may not have any references to it, is collected during GC. </field>
doc:		<field name="is_creation_procedure_logged" type="EIF_BOOLEAN"> Stores whether the creation procedure of the root object has already been logged. </field>
doc:		<field name="is_dirty" type="EIF_BOOLEAN">  Stores whether the current processor is marked as dirty (i.e. if it has encountered an exception). </field>

doc:		<fixme> There are several items to be fixed:
doc:			* For passive processors, it would make sense to split rt_processor into two structs for regions and processors.
doc:			* One could think about finding a way to replace startup_notify with something more lightweight, as it's only used once in a processor's lifecycle.
doc:			* The features used for wait condition notification could be moved into their own C file.
doc:			* It would be nice if the processor struct could be moved from the header to the source file, to enable true information hiding.
