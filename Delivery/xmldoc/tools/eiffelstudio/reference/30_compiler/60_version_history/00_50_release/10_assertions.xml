		<paragraph>One of the major differences between 4.5 and 5.0 is how to specify theassertion checking in the ace file or in the project settings window. In 4.5,assertions of a certain type where checked if their level was below therequested level. Here is what the level hierarchy looked like:</paragraph>
		<list ordered="true">
			<item>require</item>
			<item>ensure</item>
			<item>loop</item>
			<item>check</item>
			<item>invariant</item>
			<item>all</item>
		</list>
		<paragraph>Meaning that you could not just check one type of assertions. With 5.0 this isnow possible and we changed the presentation to follow the cost to evaluate agiven type of assertions, the first one being usually the less expensive:</paragraph>
		<list ordered="true">
			<item>check</item>
			<item>require</item>
			<item>ensure</item>
			<item>loop</item>
			<item>invariant</item>
			<item>all</item>
		</list>
		<paragraph>The default assertion level has changed too. Not specifying anyassertion level used to be equivalent to selecting the 'require' level. This is not the caseany more in 5.0.</paragraph>
