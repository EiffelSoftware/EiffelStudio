test_name 	cast-external-add-white-space
test_description A class has an external function which specifies a cast of the return type (i.e., `external "C :EIF_INTEGER"').  After initial compilation where the system is frozen, system execution works but produces the wrong result.  Then some white space is added inside the Language_name portion of the external, leaving its semantics unchanged and the system is melted.  System execution then ends with a segmentation fault.
