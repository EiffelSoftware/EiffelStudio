test_name 	implicit-def-create-finalize
test_description A system has a root class which explicitly names `default_create' as creation procedure and redefines `default_create' to print something. The Ace file specifies the root class, but does not specify a creation procedure.  After initial compilation where the system is melted, system execution correctly calls the redefined default_create.  But when the system is finalized with no changes, the finalized system produces no output and the redefined `default_create' has been removed by dead code removal.
