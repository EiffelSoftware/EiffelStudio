A particular root class has a validity violation discovered in pass 3.
If when the compiler stops the name of the root class is changed so
that it is different (but the class is left in the same file so that
file name root and class name do not match), but the new class name
does not match the name of any other classes in the universe, an
exception trace results.

Fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
