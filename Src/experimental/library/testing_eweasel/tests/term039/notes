A system is compiled with an Ace which specifies NONE as the root
class and also specifies a root creation procedure.  Compilation
proceeds without problems until the compiler tries to melt changes,
when it dies with an exception trace.  Also dies if the system is frozen.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
