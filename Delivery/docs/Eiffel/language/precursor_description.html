      <h1>The Precursor construct</h1>
      <p>This document describes a proposal, initially by Bertrand Meyer, to the
      language committee of NICE, the Nonprofit International Consortium for
      Eiffel. The proposal was approved by the language committee by vote in
      October of 1997. The Board of NICE is expected to ratify it shortly.
      <p>This short document describes the mechanism informally. It is an ISE
      document and does not commit NICE. A companion document contains the text
      of the <a HREF="old_precursor_construct.html">formal proposal</a> as adopted by the NICE
      language committee, and you will find <a href="precursor_construct.html">here</a>
      the modification that ISE did with version 4.5.
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This is a proposal for an extension to the Eiffel language. The author
      takes full responsibility for the wording of the proposal and for any
      error or inconsistency in it.
      <p>The credit for the basic invention, however, is to be shared between
      the following people (in alphabetical order): Roger Browne, James McKim,
      Bertrand Meyer, Frieder Monninger, Steve Tynor and Kim Waldén.
      <h2>Rationale and background</h2>
      <p>In writing classes, it frequently occurs that the redefinition of a
      routine <i>r</i> must rely on the original algorithm. A typical scheme is
      <pre><font color="#0000a0">
	<i>r</i> (<i>arguments</i>) <b>is</b>
			<font COLOR="#FF0000">-- Redefined version</font>
		<b>do</b>
			&quot;Parent version of <i>r</i>&quot; (arguments)
			&quot;Some complementary actions&quot;
		<b>end</b>
</pre>
      </font>
      <p>although other variants also occur (for example the actual arguments
      might be different from the formal ones, or the complementary actions
      might come before rather than after the call to the original version).
      <p>In the language defined by the book &quot;Eiffel: The Language&quot;
      (Prentice Hall, 1992, hereafter &quot;ETL&quot;), the mechanism that
      achieves this result is based on repeated inheritance. The redefining
      class inherits a second time from the parent containing the original
      version of <i>r</i>; that second inheritance clause does not redefine <i>r</i>,
      so that the original version remains available. That version will be
      renamed, and typically it will be neither selected nor exported. The
      scheme is
      <pre><font color="#0000a0">
	<b>indexing</b><i>
			description</i>:<i>
				&quot;A class that redefines r while using the %
				 original A version in the redefinition&quot;
	</i><b>class</b> <i>B</i> <b>inherit</b><i>

			A
				</i><b>redefine</b><i>
					r
				</i><b>select</b><i>
					r
				</i><b>end</b><i>
	
			A
				</i><b>rename</b><i>
					r </i><b>as</b><i> original_r
				</i><b>export</b><i>
					</i>{<i>NONE</i>}<i> </i><b>all</b><i>
				</i><b>end</b>
	<b>feature</b><i>

			r </i>(<i>...</i>)<i> </i><b>is</b><i>
				</i><b>do</b><i>
					original_r </i>(<i>...</i>)<i>
					other_actions
				</i><b>end</b>
	
			... Other feature declarations or redeclarations

	<b>end</b> <font COLOR="#FF0000">-- class</font> B
</pre>
      </font>
      <p>This mechanism clearly works, and has not been a major impediment to
      the development of large, highly successful Eiffel systems, or to the
      teaching of Eiffel to tens of thousands of students of all levels.
      <p>It has been criticized, however, particularly on the basis of the
      following considerations:
      <ul>
        <li> 1. It is a little difficult to
        explain to beginners. There is a discrepancy between the relative
        simplicity of the goal (gaining access to the original version of a
        redefined feature) and the heaviness of the solution, involving a new
        Parent clause, <i>export</i>, <i>rename</i> and <i>select</i>.</li>
        <li> 2. Even for non-novices, the
        heaviness may become a nuisance when a non-trivial inheritance structure
        is involved. For example B may redefine other features beyond <i>A</i>,
        or may already be a repeated descendant of <i>A</i>. This can make the
        Inheritance clause more complicated than would seem desirable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The present proposal - resulting from extensive discussions on both
      comp.lang.eiffel and the NICE Language Committee, initiated by a detailed
      posting by Roger Browne on comp.lang.eiffel in June of 1995 - is an
      attempt to address the issue simply and effectively. The challenge was to
      simplify the task at hand - providing access to the original version of a
      redefined feature - while respecting the following uncontrovertible
      obligations:
      <ul>
        <li> Keeping the language simple.</li>
        <li> Not introducing redundancy.</li>
        <li> Not violating correctness
        requirements.</li>
        <li> Not violating information hiding
        (which excludes in particular a Smalltalk-like <i>super</i> mechanism).</li>
        <li> Not impairing the ability to produce
        efficient compilers.</li>
        <li> Not complicating in any significant
        way the structure of existing compilers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The result is based on the following idea: do <b>not</b> define the
      original <i>r</i> as a &quot;feature of the class&quot; <i>B</i>; instead,
      provide a limited mechanism that allows the body of a redefined routine
      such as <i>r</i> - and <b>only</b> such a body - to refer to the original,
      under a special syntax.
      <p>This, we hope, achieves the goal of a minimal extension that solves one
      of the very few reported sore points of Eiffel development without
      complicating the language significantly or affecting the spirit of its
      design.
      <h2>Auxiliary effect</h2>
      <p>It has been stated that a good language extension should whenever
      possible solve several problems at once. One of the consequences of the
      &quot;Precursor&quot; extension described below is a slight change to the
      inheritance mechanism which, we think, will improve the language. (This
      change conforms to the semantics which was already implemented by ISE
      Eiffel, departing from the ETL semantics.)
      <p>This secondary change is a generalization of the Join mechanism, used
      to merge <i>n</i> inherited features with <i>n</i> &gt;= 2. Under the ETL
      semantics at most one of these features may be effective. Under the new
      semantics this rule is removed; any number of effective and deferred
      routines may be &quot;joined&quot; (merged) provided all the effective
      ones figure in Redefine clauses in the corresponding Parent parts.
      <p>This appears to simplify both the semantic description of the language
      and its practical use, avoiding the need to undefine n-1 effective
      routines, artificially chosen, out of <i>n</i> that one may want to join.
      <h2>A practical note for OOSC-2 readers</h2>
      <p>The book <a HREF="../books.html"><i>Object-Oriented Software
      Construction, second edition</i></a> (Prentice Hall, 1997) describes the
      mechanism with a small syntactic differences: it uses double braces, as in
      {{<i>PARENT</i>}}, rather than single braces as in {<i>PARENT</i>}.
      <p>To avoid any confusion, ISE's compiler accepts both form. The
      single-brace form is the recommended form.
      <h2>The formal proposal</h2>
      <p>The precise proposal as approved by the NICE language committee appears
      in a <a HREF="old_precursor_construct.html">separate page</a>.
