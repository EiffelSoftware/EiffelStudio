-- This class is used during Degree 3. When replication is detected
-- (detect_replication in SELECTION_LIST), a rep_name is created
-- to firstly save the replicated routine. New_feature is different
-- to rep_feature in such that the rep_feature was recorded before
-- the unselect process was done. Hence, new_feature is the lastest
-- version with the rep_feature feature_name from the feature_table.
-- old_feature refers to the feature in which the origin of rep_feature
-- comes from.
