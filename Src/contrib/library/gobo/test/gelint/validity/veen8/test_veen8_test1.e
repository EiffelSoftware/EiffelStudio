	description:

		"Test for validity rule VEEN-8"

	remark: "[
		In this test, we have something like that:

			bb and then {l: STRING} s and then l.is_empty

		where `bb' is not a boolean expression. Therefore the expression
		'l.is_empty' is not in the scope of the object-test local.
		Indeed, the standard:
		
			ECMA 367-2, section 8.24.4 p.128: "Definition: Conjunctive,
			disjunctive, implicative; Term, semistrict term"

		explicitly mentions boolean operators between boolean expressions,
		and semi-strict operators (which are defined elsewhere in
		the standard to be exclusively parts of class BOOLEAN).
		So 'and then' with target `bb' does not meet the conditions.

		This is nevertheless accepted by ISE 6.2.7.2969, and not
		surprisingly results in a call-on-void-target at execution.
