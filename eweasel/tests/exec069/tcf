test_name 	 keep-on-stripping
test_description A class has a routine which repeatedly applies the `strip' operator to the current object and puts the resulting array in a local variable. The class has 4 INTEGER attributes.  Executing the system results in a run-time panic.  Reducing the number of attributes to 3 or turning off garbage collection allows the system to execute correctly for a huge number of iterations.
