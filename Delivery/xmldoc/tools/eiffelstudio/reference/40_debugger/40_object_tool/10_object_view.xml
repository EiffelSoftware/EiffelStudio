		<paragraph>The second tree in the 
			<link>
				<url>00_introduction.xml</url>
				<label>object tool</label>
			</link> gives information about objects. By default, the first object in the object view is the object corresponding to the 
			<link>
				<url>../30_call_stack_tool/00_introduction.xml</url>
				<label>current stack element</label>
			</link>. However, it is possible to drop any object onto the object view to manage it. Whereas the object corresponding to the current stack element may change each time the application is stopped, objects that were manually added to the object view are kept. They are only discarded when the application exits, or when the 
			<link>
				<url>30_remove_object_command.xml</url>
				<label>remove object command</label>
			</link> is used.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>All objects can be expanded to see the 
			<link>
				<url>15_attribute_symbols.xml</url>
				<label>value of their attributes</label>
			</link>. They are also 
			<link>
				<url>../../../../../tools/eiffelstudio/reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.xml</url>
				<label>pickable</label>
			</link>, so that it is possible to drop them onto an editor, to inspect the class the object belongs to. It is also possible to use the 
			<link>
				<url>20_slice_size_command.xml</url>
				<label>set slice size command</label>
			</link> with <link><url>/libraries/base/reference/kernel/SPECIAL_chart.xml</url><label><code><class_name>SPECIAL</class_name></code></label></link> objects.
