A small class with a loop invariant (both class and loop invariant
appear to be valid) causes the "Make_byte_code applied to void
reference" error.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.  However, it now dies with
violation of precondition of `generate_workbench_tes' instead.

Fixed in Prerelease 93.07.15.
