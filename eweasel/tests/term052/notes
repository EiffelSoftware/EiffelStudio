A generic class has a constraint `-> TEST2 [STRING]' on its formal
generic parameter, which is invalid since TEST2 is indeed a generic
class but its formal generic parameter is constrained by `LIST
[STRING]'.  The compiler correctly reports a VTCG violation, but dies
while trying to report the name of the class on which the error occurred.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
