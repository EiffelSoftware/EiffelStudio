An error occured in the renaming clause of a formal generic.
Hint: The renaming for formal generics is analogous to the
renaming occuring during inheritance.
What to do:
In the case of a multi-constraint generic (like in  'G -> {A,B}')
one has to ensure that for every used feature there are no ambiguities.
In order to achieve that goal you can use a renaming clause.

For example: G -> {A rename f as g end, B}
