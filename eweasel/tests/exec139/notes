A class does an `independent_store' of an object that has two expanded
attributes, where each expanded object has an INTEGER attribute,
another attribute of an expanded type and a third attribute that is an
array of expanded.  Freezing the system works fine, but during
execution the retrieved object is not deep_equal to the original
stored object.
