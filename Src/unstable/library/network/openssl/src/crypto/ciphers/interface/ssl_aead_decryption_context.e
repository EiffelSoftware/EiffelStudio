	description: "[
		When creating an encryption context using decryptor on a SSL_CIPHER object with an AEAD mode such as GCM an object 
		conforming to both the SSL_AEAD_DECRYPTION_CONTEXT and SSL_AEAD_CIPHER_CONTEXT interfaces will be returned. 
		This interface provides one additional method finalize_with_tag that allows passing the authentication tag for validation after the ciphertext has been decrypted.
