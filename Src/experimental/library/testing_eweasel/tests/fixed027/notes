A system has a class which violates the Select Subclause rule (same
feature name appears twice).  The compiler detects the VMSS violation.
Changing the inheritance structure and then hitting return at the
"Another compilation needed..." prompt causes an exception trace.

Fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
