					<P>Eiffel software texts are free-format: distribution into
					lines is not semantically significant, and any number of
					successive space and line-return characters is equivalent to
					just one space. The style rules suggest indenting software
					texts as illustrated by the examples in this chapter.</P>
					
					<P>Successive declarations or instructions may be separated
					by semicolons. Eiffel's syntax has been so designed, however,
					that (except in rare cases)
					<SPAN CLASS="bold">the semicolon is optional</SPAN>. Omitting
					semicolons for elements appearing on separate lines lightens
					text and is the recommended practice since semicolons, as
					used by most programming languages, just obscure the text by
					distracting attention from the actual contents.
					<SPAN CLASS="italics">Do</SPAN> use semicolons if you 
					occasionally include successive elements on a single line.</P>
					
					<P>63 names -- all unabbreviated single English words, except
					for <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">elseif</SPAN> which is made of two
					words -- are reserved, meaning that you cannot use them to
					declare new entities. Here is the list:</P>

					<P CLASS=note>Since this tutorial has covered all the
					essential mechanisms, you may ignore the keywords not
					encountered; they are reserved for future use.</P>
					
					<P>Most of the reserved words are keywords, serving only as
					syntactic markers, and written in boldface in typeset texts
					such as the present one: <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN>,
					<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN>,
					<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">inherit</SPAN>. The others, such as
					<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">Current</SPAN>, directly carry a
					semantic denotation; they start with an upper-case letter
					and are typeset in boldface.</P>
					
					<P>These conventions about letter case are only style rules.
					Eiffel is case-insensitive, since it is foolish to assume
					that two identifiers denote two different things just on the
					basis of a letter written in lower or upper case. The obvious
					exception is manifest character constants (appearing in 
					single quotes, such as
					<SPAN CLASS="esymbol">'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="echar">A</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">'</SPAN>)
					and manifest character strings (appearing in double quotes,
					such as
					<SPAN CLASS="esymbol">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="estring">lower and UPPER</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">&quot;</SPAN>).
					</P>
					
					<P>The style rules, however, are precise, and any serious
					Eiffel project will enforce them; the tools of EiffelStudio
					also observe them in the texts they output (although they
					will not mess up with your source text unless you ask them to
					reformat it). Here are the conventions, illustrated by the
					examples of this tutorial:</P>
					
					<UL>
						<LI>Class names in upper case, as
						<SPAN CLASS="eclass">ACCOUNT</SPAN>.</LI>
						
						<LI>Non-constant feature names and keywords in lower
						case, as <SPAN CLASS="efeature">balance</SPAN> and
						<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN>.</LI>
						
						<LI>Constant features and predefined entities and
						expressions with an initial upper case, as
						<SPAN CLASS="efeature">Avogadro</SPAN> and
						<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">Result</SPAN>.</LI>
					</UL>
					
					<P>There is also an Eiffel style to the choice of
					identifiers. For features, stay away from abbreviations and
					use full words. In multi-word identifiers, separate the
					constituents by underscores, as in
					<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKED_LIST</SPAN> and
					<SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_owner</SPAN>. The competing style
					of no separation but mid-identifier upper-case, as in 
					<SPAN CLASS="eclass">linkedList</SPAN> or
					<SPAN CLASS="efeature">setOwner</SPAN>, is less readable and
					not in line with standard Eiffel practices.</P>
					
					<P>Features of reusable classes should use consistent names.
					A set of standard names -- <SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN>
					for the basic command to add or replace an element,
					<SPAN CLASS="efeature">count</SPAN> for the query that
					returns the number of element in a structure,
					<SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN> to access an element --
					is part of the style rules, and used systematically in
					EiffelBase. Use them in your classes too.</P>
					
					<P>For local entities and formal arguments of routines, it is
					all right to use abbreviated names, since these identifiers
					only have a local scope, and choosing a loud name would give
					them too much pretense, leading to potential conflicts with
					features.</P>
					
					<P>The complete set of style rules applied by Eiffel Software
					is available on the web in both
					<A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/language/style/">HTML</A>
					and
					<A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/language/style/style.pdf">PDF</A>
					forms. These rules are an integral part of the Eiffel method;
					in quality software, there is no such thing as a detail.
					Applying them systematically promotes consistency between
					projects in the Eiffel world, enhances reusability, and
					facilitates everyone's work.</P>
