This is the location of the template license files.

License files are located at $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/templates/licenses/*.lic, and user license
files at $ISE_USER_FILES/studio/templates/licenses/*.lic. The * represents the license name.

License files must contain the note/indexing clause text and nothing more. They will be validated
using a parse and invalid licenses will not be merged into the associated class.

The license name is extracted using the following exclusive methods:
  - From the source text under an indexing term 'licence_name'.
  - Using a license reference in a neighboring license file to a project's ECF.

From the Source:
--------------------
Assigning a license to a particular class can be accomplished by adding the `license_name' term with
a string value representing the license name used to look for a license file. See below:

    note
        licence_name: "my_license"
    class
        MY_CLASS
    ....

The license_name term should be placed in the top note/indexing clause of a class. Placing it at the
bottom will cause it to be removed when replacing a class' license.

In the case of a license_name using the license name 'my_license' the following will be attempted to
be loaded, in order or priority:		
  - $ISE_USER_FILES/studio/templates/licenses/my_license.lic
  - $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/templates/licenses/my_license.lic
    
From a License File:
--------------------
For libraries and projects with an associated ECF, a license file or a license reference file may be
used to class all classes belonging to that library or project with a particular license. The
sources do not have to be modified to accomplish this, only a license file added at the same level 
as the ECF.

A license file should use the same file name as the ECF, for a project or library, except should
used a ".lic" extension instead of one used for the ECF. The file can contain a license similar to
those in $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/templates/licenses or can contain a reference string to point to a
installed license file using a license name. For this, create the license file next to the ECF with
the contents:

    reference:name
    
where 'name' is the name of the license in $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/templates/licenses/ or
$ISE_USER_FILES/studio/templates/licenses/ you wish to apply to the project/library. For instance

   reference:my_ref_license

In the case of a reference name using the license name 'my_license' the following will be attempted
to be loaded, in order or priority:
  - $ISE_USER_FILES/studio/templates/licenses/my_ref_license.lic
  - $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/templates/licenses/my_ref_license.lic

Using the Default License:
--------------------------
Where no license name in the source or license file neighbored to an ECF is found, you have one fall
back option, which will license all other classes in all projects and libraries in this way - the
default license.

A default license is installed with EiffelStudio under
$ISE_EIFFEL/studio/templates/licenses/default.lic and is blank. This file should not be modified
unless there is good reason to do so. Instead add a user file at
$ISE_USER_FILES/studio/templates/licenses/default.lic with the license you wish to use as the
default for all other classes.
