<H1><A name=refexcep><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Exceptional
conditions</FONT></A></H1>This section lists, in the abstract, the exceptional
conditions that may arise during the operations defined in this specification.
<P>For each condition, the corresponding <I>signal</I> in the <A
href="damodel.html#refcontext"><I>context</I></A>
is given, along with the defined result. The value of the trap-enabler for each
signal in the context determines whether an operation is completed after the
condition is detected or whether the condition is trapped and hence not
necessarily completed (see IEEE 854 §8).
<P>This specification does not define the manner in which exceptions are
reported or handled. For example, in a object-oriented language, an Arithmetic
Exception object might be signalled or thrown, whereas in a calculator
application an error message or other indication might be displayed.
<P>The following exceptional conditions can occur:
<DL>
  <P>
  <DT><B>Conversion syntax</B>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>invalid-operation</I> if an string is being
  converted to a number and it does not conform to the <A
  href="daconvs.html#refnumsyn">numeric
  string syntax</A>. The result is <TT>[0,qNaN]</TT>.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>Division by zero</B>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>division-by-zero</I> if division by zero was
  attempted (during a <B>divide-integer</B> or <B>divide</B> operation, or a
  <B>power</B> operation with negative right-hand operand), and the dividend was
  not zero.
  <P>The result of the operation is <TT>[</TT><I>sign</I><TT>,inf]</TT>, where
  <I>sign</I> is the sign of the dividend.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>Division impossible</B>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>invalid-operation</I> if the integer result of a
  <B>divide-integer</B> or <B>remainder</B> operation had too many digits (would
  be longer than <I>precision</I>). The result is <TT>[0,qNaN]</TT>.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>Division undefined</B>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>invalid-operation</I> if division by zero was
  attempted (during a <B>divide-integer</B>, <B>divide</B>, or <B>remainder</B>
  operation), and the dividend is also zero. The result is <TT>[0,qNaN]</TT>.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>Inexact</B>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>inexact</I> whenever the result of an operation
  is not exact (that is, it needed to be rounded and any discarded digits were
  non-zero), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs. The result in all
  cases is unchanged.
  <P>The <I>inexact</I> signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a
  given operation (or sequence of operations) was inexact.<A name=backref.1><A
  href="daexcep.html#footnote.1"><FONT
  size=3><SUP>[1]</SUP></FONT></A></A>&nbsp;
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>Insufficient storage</B>
  <DD>
  <P>For many implementations, storage is needed for calculations and
  intermediate results, and on occasion an arithmetic operation may fail due to
  lack of storage. This is considered an operating environment error, which can
  be either be handled as appropriate for the environment, or treated as an
  <B>Invalid operation</B> condition. The result is <TT>[0,qNaN]</TT>.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>Invalid context</B>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>invalid-operation</I> if an invalid context was
  detected during an operation. This can occur if contexts are not checked on
  creation and either the <I>precision</I> exceeds the capability of the
  underlying concrete representation or an unknown or unsupported
  <I>rounding</I> was specified. These aspects of the context need only be
  checked when the values are required to be used. The result is
  <TT>[0,qNaN]</TT>.
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=refinvop><B>Invalid operation</B></A>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>invalid-operation</I> if:
  <UL>
    <LI>an operand to an operation is <TT>[0,sNaN]</TT> (<I>signaling NaN</I>)
    <LI>an attempt is made to add <TT>[0,inf]</TT> to <TT>[1,inf]</TT> during an
    addition or subtraction operation
    <LI>an attempt is made to multiply 0 by <TT>[0,inf]</TT> or <TT>[1,inf]</TT>

    <LI>an attempt is made to divide either <TT>[0,inf]</TT> or <TT>[1,inf]</TT>
    by either <TT>[0,inf]</TT> or <TT>[1,inf]</TT>
    <LI>the divisor for a remainder operation is zero
    <LI>the dividend for a remainder operation is either <TT>[0,inf]</TT> or
    <TT>[1,inf]</TT>
    <LI>the right-hand operand of the <B>rescale</B> operation has a non-zero
    fractional part, or is outside the permitted range
    <LI>the operand of the <B>square-root</B> operation has a <I>sign</I> of 1
    and a non-zero <I>coefficient</I>
    <LI>both operands of the <B>power</B> operation are zero, or the right-hand
    operand has a non-zero fractional part, or has more than 9 digits, or is
    infinite
    <LI>An operand is invalid. For example, certain values of concrete
    representations may not correspond to numbers; an implementation is
    permitted (but is not required) to detect these invalid values and raise
    this condition. </LI></UL><I></I>The result of the operation after any of
  these invalid operations is <TT>[0,qNaN]</TT>.
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=refoverf><B>Overflow</B></A>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>overflow</I> if the <I>adjusted exponent</I> of
  a result (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to
  divide by zero) would be greater than the largest value that can be handled by
  the implementation (the value E<SUB>max</SUB>). It also occurs if a
  <B>rescale</B> operation would require greater precision than is available.
  <P>The result depends on the rounding mode:
  <UL>
    <LI>For <I>round-half-up</I> and <I>round-half-even</I> (and for
    <I>round-half-down</I> and <I>round-up</I>, if implemented), the result of
    the operation is <TT>[</TT><I>sign</I><TT>,inf]</TT>, where <I>sign</I> is
    the sign of the intermediate result.
    <LI>For <I>round-down</I>, the result is the largest finite number that can
    be represented in the current <I>precision</I>, with the sign of the
    intermediate result.
    <LI>For <I>round-ceiling</I>, the result is the same as for
    <I>round-down</I> if the sign of the intermediate result is 1, or is
    <TT>[0,inf]</TT> otherwise.
    <LI>For <I>round-floor</I>, the result is the same as for <I>round-down</I>
    if the sign of the intermediate result is 0, or is <TT>[1,inf]</TT>
    otherwise. </LI></UL><I></I>In all cases, Inexact and Rounded will also be
  raised.
  <P><B>Note:</B> IEEE 854 §7.3 requires that the result delivered to a trap
  handler be different, depending on whether the overflow was the result of a
  conversion or of an arithmetic operation. This specification deviates from
  IEEE 854 in this respect; however, an implementation could comply with IEEE
  854 by providing a separate mechanism for the special result to a trap
  handler.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>Rounded</B>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>rounded</I> whenever the result of an operation
  is rounded (that is, some zero or non-zero digits were discarded from the
  coefficient), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs. The result in
  all cases is unchanged.
  <P>The <I>rounded</I> signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a
  given operation (or sequence of operations) caused a loss of precision.
  <P></P>
  <DT><B>Subnormal</B>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>subnormal</I> whenever the result of a
  conversion or operation is subnormal (that is, its adjusted exponent is less
  than E<SUB>min</SUB>, before any rounding). The result in all cases is
  unchanged.
  <P>The <I>subnormal</I> signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a
  given or operation (or sequence of operations) yielded a subnormal result.
  <P></P>
  <DT><A name=refunderf><B>Underflow</B></A>
  <DD>
  <P>This occurs and signals <I>underflow</I> if a result is inexact and the
  <I>adjusted exponent</I> of the result would be smaller (more negative) than
  the smallest value that can be handled by the implementation (the value
  E<SUB>min</SUB>). That is, the result is both inexact and subnormal.<A
  name=backref.2><A
  href="daexcep.html#footnote.2"><FONT
  size=3><SUP>[2]</SUP></FONT></A></A>&nbsp;
  <P>The result after an underflow will be a subnormal number rounded, if
  necessary, so that its exponent is not less than E<SUB>tiny</SUB>. This may
  result in 0 with the sign of the intermediate result and an exponent of
  E<SUB>tiny</SUB>.
  <P>In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.
  <P><B>Note:</B> IEEE 854 §7.4 requires that the result delivered to a trap
  handler be different, depending on whether the underflow was the result of a
  conversion or of an arithmetic operation. This specification deviates from
  IEEE 854 in this respect; however, an implementation could comply with IEEE
  854 by providing a separate mechanism for the result to a trap handler.
  </P></DD></DL>
<P>The Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal conditions can coincide with each other
or with other conditions. In these cases then any trap enabled for another
condition takes precedence over (is handled before) all of these, any Subnormal
trap takes precedence over Inexact, and any Inexact trap takes precedence over
Rounded.
<P>It is recommended that implementations distinguish the different conditions
listed above, and also provide additional information about exceptional
conditions where possible (for example, the operation being attempted and the
values of the operand or operands involved  see also IEEE 854 §8.1).

    <TD><FONT size=2>Note that IEEE 854 is inconsistent in its treatment of
      Inexact in that it states in §7 that the Inexact exception can coincide
      with Underflow, but does not allow the possibility of Underflow signaling
      Inexact in §7.5. It is assumed that the latter is an accidental omission.
