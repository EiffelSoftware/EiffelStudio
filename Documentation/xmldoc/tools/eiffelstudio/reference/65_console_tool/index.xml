		</heading>	
	<paragraph>In the "Command" region, the following placeholders can be used:
	</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
			<item>$class_name: this will be replaced by the name in lower case of the targeted class in editor</item>
			<item>$directory_name: this will be replaced by the directory location of the targeted class in editor</item>
			<item>$file: this will be replaced by file name part, i.e., without heading directory, of $path of the targeted class in editor</item>
			<item>$file_name: this will be replaced by the path to the targeted class in editor</item>
			<item>$f_code: this will be replaced by the F_code directory of current target, if defined</item>
			<item>$group_directory: this will be replaced by the directory of the group where targeted class in editor locates</item>
			<item>$group_name: this will be replaced by the group name of the targeted class in editor</item>
			<item>$line: this will be replaced by the line number of the cursor of the targeted class in editor</item>
			<item>$path: same as $file_name</item>
			<item>$project_directory: this will be replaced by the directory of current project, if defined</item>
			<item>$target_directory: this will be replaced by the directory of current target, if defined</item>

			<content>Buffer support</content>
		</heading>		
		<paragraph>Buffer is a way to refer to text of a class, a feature or text/selected text in an editor tab in external command. Three kinds of buffers are supported:</paragraph>
		<list>
			<item>{<class_name>SOME_CLASS</class_name>} represents text of <class_name>SOME_CLASS</class_name></item>
			<item>@{<class_name>SOME_CLASS</class_name>} represents selected text in the opened editor tab for class <class_name>SOME_CLASS</class_name></item>
			<item>{<class_name>SOME_CLASS</class_name>}.<feature_name>some_feature</feature_name> represents text of <feature_name>some_feature</feature_name> from <class_name>SOME_CLASS</class_name></item>
		</list>
		<paragraph>
			For example, if you run the command:
			<note>
				gvim {<class_name>ANY</class_name>}
			</note>
			The text of class <class_name>ANY</class_name> will be displayed in a gvim window.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			If you run the command:
			<note>
				gvim @{<class_name>ANY</class_name>}
			</note>
			And if class <class_name>ANY</class_name> is opened in an editor tab and some text is selected there, the selected text will be displayed in a gvim window.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			If you run the command:
			<note>
				gvim @{<class_name>ANY</class_name>}.<feature_name>is_equal</feature_name>
			</note>
			The text of feature <feature_name>is_equal</feature_name> from class <class_name>ANY</class_name> will be displayed in a gvim window.
		</paragraph>
		
		<paragraph>
			If you run the command:
			<note>
				gvim -d {<class_name>ANY</class_name>}.<feature_name>is_equal</feature_name> {<class_name>APPLICATION</class_name>}.<feature_name>is_equal</feature_name>
			</note>
			A gvim windows in diff mode will be opened showing the difference between <class_name>ANY</class_name>.<feature_name>is_equal</feature_name> and <class_name>APPLICATION</class_name>.<feature_name>is_equal</feature_name>.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			The text used in buffer is stored in a temporary file so whatever change done to that text won't affect the text used in EiffelStudio.
