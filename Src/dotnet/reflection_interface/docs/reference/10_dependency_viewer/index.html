		<h1>The Dependency Viewer</h1>

        <p>
			The dependency viewer lists all dependencies of the selected assembly (whose name, version, culture and public key are repeated at the top of the dialog), that is
        assemblies that are in the <a href="../00_definitions/eiffel_assembly_cache.html">Eiffel
        Assembly Cache</a> as well as assemblies that have not been imported.
		</p>

		<p>
			The dependencies appear in an table, containing the name, version, culture and public key of each
            assembly. The dependencies are automatically sorted by assembly names.
            The dependency viewer is not a modal window, which enables you to have it opened while
            still working with the Assembly Manager.
