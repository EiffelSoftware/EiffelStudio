        <p>One of the
        innovations of the new ISE Eiffel 5 environment is a set of metric
        facilities enabling developers and managers to obtain quantitative
        information about software systems and the process of producing them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Find out basic
            quantitative properties of a system, such as the number of classes,
            the number of features, how many times the system has been compiled
            and many others.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></li>
          <li>
            <p>Define new
            properties as mathematical combinations of the basic ones, and
            compute the resulting values, to get the answers to such questions as
            what percentage of my system’s routines have precondition clauses? or what is the average number of features, lines,
            or invariant clauses per class?</li>
          <li>
            <p>Vary the scope of such measurements, so that the measured result may cover a
            single feature, a class, a cluster, an entire system or an
            archive of another system to make comparisons with other projects.</li>
          <li>
            <p>Compare the
            result of the same metric over several of these scopes, to see for
            example how a project differs from those on record, or whether some
            parts of a project depart from the norms applied in others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The environment
        will support such measurements through a simple graphical interface,
        closely integrated with the rest of the Eiffel Explorer. Users of the
        environment can start applying these facilities to their systems without
        learning any theory.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Metrics, however, are notoriously subject to abuse;
        we must be wary of the temptation to revere numbers just because they are
        numbers (lies, damn lies and metrics). This note presents a
        simple approach to software metrics designed to establish a clear and
        sound basis, so that we know what we are measuring, why we are measuring
        it, and how much value we may attach to the results.</p>
