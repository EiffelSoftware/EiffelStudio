		<code_block>
	(A) Ancestors    : show the ancestor versions of a feature.
	(C) Callers      : show the callers of a feature.
	(D) Descendants  : show the descendant versions of a feature.
	(F) Flat         : show the flat form of a feature.
	(O) Homonyms     : shown the homonyms of a feature.
	(I) Implementers : show the classes implementing a feature.
	(T) Text         : show the text of a feature.

	(H) Help         : show list of commands.
	(M) Main         : go back to main menu.
	(Q) Quit         : terminate session.
	(Y) Yank         : yank (save) output of last command to a file.

		<paragraph>Each command will prompt you for the name of a class, the name of a feature in that class and a filter name; 
			you can specify these names (or just the class name) after the command.</paragraph>
