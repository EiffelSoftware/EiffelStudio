After initial compilation, an extra unused formal generic parameter is
added to a generic class and an extra actual generic parameter is
added to the only generic derivation of this class.  After
recompilation, system execution output should be unchanged, but
execution instead terminates with a segmentation fault.  The initial
compilation and recompilation can be (melt, melt) or (freeze, freeze).

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
