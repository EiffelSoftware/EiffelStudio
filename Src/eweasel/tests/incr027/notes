A root class with one formal generic parameter is correctly reported
to violate VSRC.  When a 2nd formal generic parameter of the same name
is added, the newly introduced VCFG violation is detected but the
compiler dies with an exception trace while trying to report it.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
