     Feature Name Validity rule

     It is valid for a feature f of a class C to have a
     certain final name if and only if it satisfies the
     following conditions:

        1 No other feature of C has that same feature name.

        2 If f is shared under repeated inheritance, its
          precursors all have either no Alias or the same
          alias.
