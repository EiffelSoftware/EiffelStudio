A system is frozen without a precompiled library.  Then an instruction
`print ((<<int64, int64>>).item (1));' is added to the body of the
root creation procedure and changes are melted. System execution then
dies with a precondition violation (index_small_enough), though it
should not.

Reported by Manu in release 5.1.12.
