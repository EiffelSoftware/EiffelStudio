		<H1>Vision2 Containers</H1>
			<P>
			All vision2 containers inherit <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_container_chart.html">EV_CONTAINER</A>
			</P>
		<H2>What is a container?</h2>
		<P>
		A container is a Vision2 widget that may contain other widgets. Some containers such as <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/container/ev_cell_chart.html">EV_CELL</A>
		may only hold one widget while containers such as <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/container/ev_box_chart.html">EV_BOX</A> may hold multiple widgets. As a container is
		of type <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chrt.html">EV_WIDGET</A>, this means that a container may be placed within a container.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="note"><B>Note:</B>An <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/items/index.html">item</A> may not be placed in a container, only in select primitives.</P>
		<H2>Inheritance from Base</h2>
		<P>
		Wherever possible, vision2 containers are descendents of <A HREF="/libraries/base/index.html">Base</A> container structures. This provides three main advantages:
			<OL>
				<LI>Familiar operations for operations such as access, insertions and removals. Anybody who already uses <A HREF="/libraries/base/index.html">Base</A> should
				find it easy to adapt to using Vision2 containers.
				<LI>The underlying structures used have been tried and tested for many years and their design has been proved to be robust and effective.
				<LI>It provides powerful methods of querying the contents. In the original Vision library, you needed to keep reference to widgets
				as you could not query the contents of a container.
			</OL>
		</P>
		<P>For example, <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/container/ev_container_chart.html">EV_CONTAINER</A> inherits <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/base/reference/structures/storage/box_chart.html">BOX</A> and
		<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/base/reference/structures/acess/collection_chart.html">COLLECTION</A>. Descendents of <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/container/ev_container_chart.html">EV_CONTAINER</A> such as
		<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/container/ev_box_chart.html">EV_BOX</A> may also inherit other structures from <A HREF="/libraries/base/index.html">Base</A>.
