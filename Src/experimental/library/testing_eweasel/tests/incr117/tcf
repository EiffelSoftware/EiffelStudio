test_name 	 new-precomp-cluster-bogus-vd41
test_description A system is compiled with an Ace which references a precompiled cluster that is invalid, so it cannot be retrieved.  After the VD41 error is reported, the Ace is changed to indicate a valid precompiled cluster.  But the compiler reports a VD41 on the new (valid) precompiled cluster.
