<h1>Garbage collector settings</h1>

<p>Dated from September 1999.</p>
<h2>Garbage collector marking algorithm</h2>
<h3>Iterative marking</h3>
<p>The marking of the objects is iterative. This algorithm is robust, but slower 
than the others. It is usually used with Operating Systems, which cannot support 
a high level of recursion, such as VXWORKS. </p>
<h3> Recursive marking</h3>
<p>The marking of objects is recursive. This algorithm is fast but may cause a 
stack overflow if your system uses objects, which have a high level of 
references, such as LINKED_LISTs.</p>
<h3>Hybrid marking</h3>
<p>This algorithm combines both iterative and recursive mechanisms. It is slightly 
slower than the recursive mechanism but it can handle objects with a high level 
of references. This is the default.</p>
<h2>Garbage collector mode</h2>
<h3>Generation scavenging</h3>
<p>The garbage collector uses a copying and generation based algorithm. Unlike the 
Mark-and-Sweep, this algorithm moves the objects, allocation is faster, 
fragmentation and page faults are reduced. Moreover, it only scans the young 
objects, assuming that the older an object is, the longer it is likely to 
survive: this makes the GC heap smaller and consequently collections are faster. 
However, this mode requires a lot of memory.</p>
<h3>Mark-and-Sweep</h3>
<p>This algorithm is robust but slower in all aspects. The main advantage is that 
it does not move the objects: therefore interfacing a system with another 
language is easier, since it does not require to use the Cecil protection 
mechanism. It does not require a lot of memory but may produce fragmentation.</p>
<h3>Partial scavenging</h3>
<p>This algorithm is a compacting Mark-and-Sweep combined with a cycling Scavenging 
on the whole memory. Not too much memory is required and fragmentation is 
avoided. It is a faster than the Mark-and-Sweep mechanism.</p>
<h3>Default mode</h3>
<p>Generation scavenging is applied only for small objects. Otherwise objects are 
allocated in a Partial Scavenging area. In fact, the memory is divided in two 
areas running their own algorithm.</p>
<h2>Garbage collector optimization</h2>
<h3>Big arrays optimization</h3>
<p>The Garbage collector may take a long time in scanning huge arrays of 
references, this algorithm makes the time spent in scanning these objects only 
proportional to the number of its new sub-references. This is implemented for 
4.5 and is the default on this version. It can easily be added to previous 
versions. However, It may be useless on small systems, which do not allocate big 
arrays. In the latter case, it is better to disable it since it brings 
substantial overhead.</p>
<h3>String optimization</h3>
<p>It allocates the Eiffel Strings in the Generation Scavenge Zone, making their 
allocation faster. It is disabled by default.</p>
<h3>Memory objects optimization</h3>
<p>In the same manner as the string optimization, it allocates the objects of type 
MEMORY, which are usually those that encapsulate C objects, in the GSZ instead 
of the partial scavenging area. Their allocation is faster. This optimization is 
on the version 4.5, and disabled by default on 4.4 </p>
<h2>Parameters settings</h2>
<p>Additionally the user can define some GC parameters (see class MEMORY)</p>
<h3>Size of memory chunks</h3>
<p>The Eiffel run-time allocates memory in chunks. You can define their size.</p>
<h3>Size of Generation Scavenging zone</h3>
<p>The generation scavenge zone is dedicated for small and young objects. You can 
define its size.</p>
<h3>Maximum size of objects allocated in the Generation scavenge zone</h3>
<p>This defines what is a small object. Objects under this size are allocated in 
the GSZ (except the objects of type SPECIAL, such as ARRAYs or STRINGs)</p>
<h3>Maximum age before tenuring.</h3>
<p>This defines the maximum age of an object before it is tenured, which means that 
it will be considered as old and reallocated in the partial scavenging area, if 
it is not there yet. The age of an object corresponds to the number of 
Generation collection that it has survived. A generation collection is a light, 
local collection, which scans only the young objects.</p>
<h3>Period of full collection</h3>
<p>Every P collection, a full collection is launched, otherwise a Generation 
collection is done. A full collection is expensive because it scans the whole 
memory, both GSZ and partial scavenging area, which means young and old objects. 
It does not make any aging unlike the Generation collection. </p>
<h3> Period of full coalesce</h3>
<p>Every P collections, a full coalesce is performed. It applies to the whole 
memory and tries to compact it as much as possible. By default, its value is 
null, which means that no full coalesce is done: the GC algorithms should be 
sufficient.</p>
<h3>Memory threshold</h3>
<p>Every M bytes requested in the free-lists, a collection is launched. This does 
not include the memory allocated in the GSZ, since there are pre-allocated 
buffers for small and young objects. </p>
<h3> Maximum amount of memory allocated allowed</h3>
<p>If the amount of memory exceeds this limit, an Eiffel exception is raised. It is 
a per thread value.</p>
