		Overview
       </h3>
       <p>

		<P>A Control is a window which provides a means of interacting with the
		application. For example, a <A CLASS ="eclass" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/controls/wel_edit_chart.html">WEL_EDIT</A> provides
		a user with the means of entering and modifying text. There are many <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="common_controls.html">common controls</A> available within this cluster,
		each with a specific use.</P>
		
		<P CLASS="note">
		<B>Note:</B> Each control inherits from <A CLASS ="eclass" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/controls/wel_control_chart.html">WEL_CONTROL</A>
		which is a descendent of <A CLASS ="eclass" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/windows/wel_window_chart.html">WEL_WINDOW</A> This provides the control with a
		large number of general features (including full window functionality). Each control also provides its own feature set which give access to
		specific properties of that control.
       </P>

		Creating controls
       </h3>
       <p>
       <P>Each type of control generally has its own creation procedure that is specific to the type of control. For example, <A CLASS ="eclass" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/controls/wel_scroll_bar_chart.html">WEL_SCROLL_BAR</A>
        has two creation procedures <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/controls/wel_scroll_bar.html#f_make_vertical">make_vertical</A> 
        and <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/controls/wel_scroll_bar.html#f_make_horizontal">make_horizontal</A>. Depending on which of these two
        creation procedures used, you will get a scroll bar aligned vertically or one aligned horizontally.
  		</P>
