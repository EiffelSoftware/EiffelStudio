After initial compilation where the system is frozen, a class that
prints the value of a boolean constant, which is False, works
correctly.  When the constant value is changed to True and system
refrozen, the correct value is still printed.  Then the system is
finalized and execution prints False.  Similar problem for reals and
doubles.
