A class has a call to a function which takes an argument of type BIT N
and just returns its argument.  The system compiles fine, but when
executed it dies with the exception "object allocation: No more
memory" if it was melted and if N >= 32768 (2 ^ 15).  Frozen code
works fine for BIT sizes up to at least 1_000_000.

Discovered in Release 3.3 beta.
