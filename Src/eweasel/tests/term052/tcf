test_name 	 vtcg-expanded-generic
test_description A generic class has a constraint `-> TEST2 [STRING]' on its formal generic parameter, which is invalid since TEST2 is indeed a generic class but its formal generic parameter is constrained by `LIST [STRING]'.  The compiler correctly reports a VTCG violation, but dies while trying to report the name of the class on which the error occurred.
