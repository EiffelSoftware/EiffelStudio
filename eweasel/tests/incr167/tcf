test_name 	 make-synonyms-vupr-sneak
test_description After initial compilation, two routines which were declared separately are changed so that they share a single redeclaration, which calls precursor.  When the system is recompiled, the compiler does not detect the VUPR(1) error.

define HEADER "f1"
define OTHER "f2 is do precursor {TEST2} end"
copy_sub 	Ace $TEST Ace
copy_raw 	test.e $CLUSTER test.e
copy_sub 	test1.e $CLUSTER test1.e
copy_raw 	test2.e $CLUSTER test2.e
compile_melted
compile_result 	ok

define HEADER "f1, f2"
define OTHER ""
copy_sub 	test1.e $CLUSTER test1.e

compile_result 	validity_error TEST1 VUPR(1) VUPR(1)
