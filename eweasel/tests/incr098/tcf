test_name 	 redef-external-chg-to-effect
test_description A class inherits an external routine and tries to redefine it, but includes some locals in the redefined external routine.  The compiler catches the VRRR(2) error.  Then the parent version is changed to a deferred feature and the child version is changed to a non-external routine.
