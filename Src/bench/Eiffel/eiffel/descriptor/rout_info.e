	description: "[
		Information about a routine.
		A routine represents a feature with all its versions in descendant classes, 
		obtained through renaming or adaptation. a new routine is introduced either 
		when there are no precursors or trough duplication (in the case of repeated 
		inheritance). a routine has an origin, which is the class in which it was 
		introduced, and an offset which is an unique identification number of the 
		routine in the origin class.
		Currently the offset mechanism is only used in workbench mode since it is 
		more incremental but yields less efficient feature call mechanism.
