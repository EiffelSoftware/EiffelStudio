	description: "[
		Objects that permit custom positioning of a `text' and `pixmap' within an EV_GRID_LABEL_ITEM.
		You may not create these objects. To use, connect an agent to `layout_procedure' of EV_GRID_LABEL_ITEM
		and an instance of this class is passed as an argument when the action sequence is fired. Fill in the
		attributes as required and the `text' and `pixmap' of the EV_GRID_LABEL_ITEM are positioned accordingly.
		All coordinates are 0 based.

feature -- Access

	grid_label_item: detachable EV_GRID_LABEL_ITEM
			-- Associated EV_GRID_LABEL_ITEM to which the properties of `Current' are applied.

	pixmap_x: INTEGER
			-- Horizontal position to be used for drawing `grid_label_item.pixmap', relative
			-- to the left edge of `grid_label_item'.

	pixmap_y: INTEGER
			-- Vertical position to be used for frawing `grid_label_item.pixmap', relative
			-- to the top edge of `grid_label_item'.

	text_x: INTEGER
			-- Horizontal position to be used for drawing `grid_label_item.text', relative
			-- to the left edge of `grid_label_item'.

	text_y: INTEGER
			-- Vertical position to be used for drawing `grid_label_item.text', relative
			-- to the top edge of `grid_label_item'.

	has_text_pixmap_overlapping: BOOLEAN
			-- Can text and pixmap overlap? If not, text will be truncated to the smallest of `pixmap_x'
			-- and `grid_label_item.width' when `text_x' is smaller than `pixmap_x'.

feature -- Status Setting

feature {EV_ANY_I} -- Implementation
