An operator feature which is a prefix feature implemented as an
attribute cannot be named in a strip expression.  This is (possibly) a
language design problem rather than a compiler bug, since ETL allows
only a list of Identifiers inside the parentheses of a strip
expression.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.05.17.
