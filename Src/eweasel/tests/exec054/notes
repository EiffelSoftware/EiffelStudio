A class does a comparison INTEGER_REF > INTEGER.  This should be
legal, since INTEGER conforms to INTEGER_REF, and the compiler accepts
it.  But executing the system results in an exception trace
(segmentation fault or bus error).  Same thing for REALs, DOUBLEs and
CHARACTERs.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
