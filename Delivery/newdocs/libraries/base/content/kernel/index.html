		<H1>The Kernel</H1>
			<P>
				In addition to basic concepts close to the language level, the Kernel covers such
				common needs as <B>input</B> and <B>output</B>, <B>storage</B> and
				<B>retrieval</B> of objects on persistent storage, fine control over <B><B>exception
				handling</B> and <B>memory management</B>, and access to
				<B>operating system facilities</B>. The kernel can be divided into 5 logical
				clusters of classes:
			<UL>
				<LI>The first cluster contains the universal class defining facilities accessible to all
					other classes: <A HREF="../../reference/kernel/any.html">ANY</A>.
					Every developer-defined class is a descendant of this class.
				<LI>The second cluster includes classes whose facilities are directly related to
					language concepts:
					<UL>
						<LI>Classes describing the basic types: BOOLEAN, CHARACTER, INTEGER, REAL
						and DOUBLE
						<LI>Arrays: class ARRAY
						<LI>Strings: class STRING
						<LI>Basic facilities: classes BASIC_ROUTINES for conversions, MATH_CONST
						<LI>SINGLE_MATH and DOUBLE_MATH for mathematical values and functions
						<LI>PRIMES for prime numbers, RANDOM for pseudo-random sequences, ASCII for character codes
					</UL>
