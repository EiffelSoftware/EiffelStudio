		A scoped utility class to automatically clean up marshalled API data. Using a cleaner simplifies
		unmanaged resource management by performing collections of multiple piece of data with a single
		call to `clean'.
		
		Using scope object expiration - creating an instance in a routine and have it collected by the GC
		because it becomes unreachable after the routine exists.
