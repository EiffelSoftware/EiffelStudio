A multi-branch with a unique constant which occurs in more than one
"when" branch is reported as violating VOMB(4), which is correct.  But
the compiler also reports a spurious VOMB(3) error (VOMB(3) does not
apply since there are no non-Unique inspect constants in the example).

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
