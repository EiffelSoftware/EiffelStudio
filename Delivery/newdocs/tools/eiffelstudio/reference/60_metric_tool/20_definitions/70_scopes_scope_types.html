        <h1>Scopes and scope types</h1>
        <p>Every metric has a scope:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b>Scope of a metric</b>:<br>
        The <b>scope </b>of a metric
        is defined as follows:<br>
        &nbsp;• For a raw product metric, the type of product over which the
        metric is counted, such as: a feature, a class, a cluster, a system, an
        archive built for a given systems to make it possible to compare systems
        one to another.<br>
        • For a raw process metric, the type of process on which the metric is
        measured, such as analysis, documentation, entire project etc.<br>
        • For a derived metric (recursively), the scope of the raw metric from
        which it is derived.<br>
        • For a composite metric (recursively), the
        largest of the scopes of all its constituent metrics, where cluster is
        “larger than” class and so on.


        </P>
        <P>&nbsp; </P>

        <p>This
        notion also applies to measures:</font>
        </p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b>Scope of a measure</b>:<br>
        The <b>scope </b>of a measure is defined as follows:<br>
        • For an elementary measure (the application of an elementary metric,
        raw or derived), the set of products or processes to which the
        associated metric has been applied to yield the measure.<br>
        • For a composite measure, the union of (recursively) the scopes of
        its constituent measures.&nbsp;
        </P>
        <p>For
        both metrics and measures, the notion of scope will help us compare our
        quantitative assessments to some already on record. For example you may
        compare the value of a certain metric, such as number of invariant
        clauses in each class, with the values that have been archived for your
        project, for a reference project such as the EiffelBase library, for the
        previous projects of your company, or for a global set of previous
        projects maintained at some central location. You may also, with
        appropriate permissions, update such a shared archive with the values
        from your own measurements.

        </p>
        <p>In
        the environment, the notion of scope will be handled in a simple way.

        </p>
        <p>There
        will be a set of predefined scopes, corresponding to software units:
        feature, class, cluster, system. Any scope beyond the system level will
        be defined by “measurement archives”, as explained next.

        </p>
        <p>For product scopes,
        we will also rely on the notion of scope type:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b><a name="scope_type">Scope type</a></b><a name="scope_type">:</a><br>

        Every product scope has a <b>scope
        type</b>, denoting the type of software unit of which it is an instance,
        for example Class for a class.</P>
        <p>The metric tool provides a combo box listing all scope types. This
        one is being shrunk or extended regarding the selected scope object:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/Metrics_png/scopecombobox.png"></p>
        <p>Unlike the other tables, which list
        their entries alphabetically, the above list shows scopes types from smaller
        to larger. This list indeed defines an <b>order relation </b>between
        scope types, which follows from the containment relation of the
        corresponding software units: every class contains features; every
        cluster contains classes; and so on.</p>
