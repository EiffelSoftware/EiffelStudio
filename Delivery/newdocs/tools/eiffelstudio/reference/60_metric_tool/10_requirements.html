        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <P>All engineering
        disciplines other than software rely on quantitative approaches to
        design their products, organize the production process, and assess the
        results. Software engineering too can benefit from measuring relevant
        properties of its products and processes.</P>
        <P>Measurements are
        not an end in themselves; they must be related to broader goals of
        software engineering:</P>
        <P CLASS="note"><B>Purpose of software measurements</B>:<br>The
        purpose of software measurements is to provide quantitative assessments
        or predictions of properties of software products and
        processes </P>
        <p>For any
        numerical measure that we propose we must have precise information on
        four properties: coverage, trustworthiness, relevance, theory.<o:p>
        </p>
        <P CLASS="note"><B>Desirable features of software measurements</B>:<br>Any
        quantitative report on software products or processes should satisfy the
        following properties:<br>
        <b>- Coverage</b>:
            include a definition of what is being measured, sufficient to enable
            repetition of the measurements.<br>
        <b>- Trustworthiness</b>:
            include an estimate of how much the results can be believed, in
            particular of their precision (expected variations in case of
            repetition).<br>
        <b>- Relevance</b>:
            specify interesting properties of software products or processes on
            which the measurement may provide insight.<br>
        <b>- Theory:</b>
        include arguments backing the statement of
            relevance.</P>
