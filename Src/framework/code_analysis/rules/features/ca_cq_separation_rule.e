			RULE #4: No command-query separation (possible function side effect)
			
			To the client of a class it is not
			important whether a query is implemented as an attribute or as a
			function. When a class evolves an attribute may be changed into a
			function, for example. A function should never change the state of
			an object. A function containing a procedure call, assigning to an
			attribute, or creating an attribute is a strong indication that this
			principle is violated. This rule applies exactly in these three
			last-mentioned cases. There are rather exceptional but sometimes useful
			class designs in which the externally visible state of an object (i. e.
			the values of exported queries) does not change even though the function
			contains a rule-violating instruction.
