<h1>Debug/Profile Tab</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is what the debug tab looks like when you have not yet compiled the system
you just created.  It comprises two tabs, the first and default tab for debugging
options and the second for program execution options.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../../../images/eiffelstudio/project_settings/debug_debug.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Debug options</h2>
<p>By default all debug clauses are turned off.</p>

<p>The first step to enable them is to select the `Enable debug' check box. Then right-click on
the debug clauses you want to enable/disable and a
contextual menu will appear to let you do so.</p>

<p class="tip"><b>Tip</b>: You can select several debug clauses at a time by using the Ctrl
and Shift keys.  </p>

<p>Before you compile for the first time your project with an Ace file that has
been automatically created, you
won't see any debug clauses. They will be automatically added by the compiler at
the end of your first compilation. When this is done, you can
enable/disable each one of them.</p>


<h2>Program Execution</h2>
<p>You can specify the location from where your program will run. By default the
location is `your_project_path/EIFGEN/W_code'. Use this option when your
application relies on the use of resource files located at a different location.</p>
<p>You can also specify one or more command line arguments. The first step is to enable them
by selecting the 'Enable arguments' check box.  If this box is not checked the
system will run without any arguments.  Selecting it will enable the arguments notebook which
provides two type of arguments, 'Program Arguments' and 'My Arguments'.  
Program Arguments are those that reside in the project Ace file and are therefore system-wide.
My Arguments are user specific and are stored in a separate file from the Ace.&nbsp;
Below is the debug tab with the arguments tab selected.</p>  

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../../../../images/eiffelstudio/project_settings/debug_args.png"></p>

<p>To add 
a new argument select the desired tab, type the arguments into the Current Argument text box and then
click 'Add'.  To select an argument simply click the argument as it appears in the list or select
it from the drop-down combo box.  Once selected the argument can be set by clicking 'Apply' or
'OK', or it can be removed by clicking 'Remove'.  To edit an existing argument double-click the
corresponding argument in the list box.  This will display an editable text field whereby the argument
can be edited.  The same execution options are also accessible from any of the program debugging and 
launching toolbar buttons in the main EiffelStudio development window.  To display them right-click
on any of these buttons, or for more information click here.

<h2>Miscellaneous options</h2>
<ul>
  <li>line number generation when selected will generate in either .NET
    generation or C generation some extra information that will enable a .NET
    debugger or a C debugger to step through the Eiffel code rather than MSIL
    code or C code.</li>
  <li>call tracing when selected will, in C generation mode only, display on the
    console all the features that are called during the system execution.</li>
  <li>profiling when selected will, in C generation mode, turn on the Eiffel
    profiler during the application execution. The results can be seen at the end of the
    execution in <a href="../70_wizards_and_dialogs/10_profiler_wizard/00_introduction.html">the
    profiler window</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><b>Note</b>: The profiler is only available in the Enterprise edition of
EiffelStudio.</p>
