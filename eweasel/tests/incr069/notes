The compiler correctly detects and reports a VCFG violation when a
generic class has a formal generic parameter with the same name as a
class in the universe.  But when an inheritance clause is deleted,
thereby removing the generic class from the universe, the compiler
still reports a VCFG violation on the generic class.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
