A class repeatedly creates an instance of another class which has one
attribute of an expanded type.  The base class of the expanded type
has a creation procedure which allocates a small amount of memory to
initialize the value of a string attribute.  If the system is melted,
a segmentation fault occurs when the system is executed.  Frozen code
works fine.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
