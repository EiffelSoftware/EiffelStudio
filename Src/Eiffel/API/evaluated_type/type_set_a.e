					 Set of types. This class encapsulates features to handle conformance and feature lookup on a set of types .
					 Refactoring:
					 TODO: This class could be made generic constrained to TYPE_A. 
					 The issue is that the agent conformance does not allow it because some features become invalid.
					 TODO: feature_i_* and e_feature_* are very similar. Maybe get rid of e_feature_*?
