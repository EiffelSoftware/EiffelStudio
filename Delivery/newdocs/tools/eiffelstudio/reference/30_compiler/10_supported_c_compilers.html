		<H1>Supported C compilers</H1>
                <h2>Unix/Linux Users:</h2>
        <p>ISE EiffelStudio supports `gcc' on most platforms and the
                native `cc' compiler if it is an ANSI C compiler.</p>
                <h2>Microsoft Visual C++ Users</h2>
                <p>ISE EiffelStudio supports only version 6.0 of the
                Microsoft Visual C++ environment. You can still use older
                versions of the Microsoft C++ environment (version 4.1, 4.2 or
                5.0),
                but this won't be supported by ISE.</p>
                <p>Make sure that the Microsoft tools are correctly setup to run
                from the MS-DOS prompt:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>On Windows NT or 2000, the installation of VC++ should do it
                    automatically.
                  <li>On Windows 95/98/Me, you need to copy the content of the file
                    `vcvars32.bat' from the `bin' directory of the VC
                    installation into your autoexec.bat file and to reboot your
                    machine so that changes take effect.</li>
                </ul>
        <p>By default the installation program will set in the registry
                keys the ISE_C_COMPILER key to `msc'.&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Borland C++ Users:</h2>
        <p>ISE EiffelStudio only supports version 5.5 of
                Borland C++. In order to make the Borland tools work with the
                ISE EiffelStudio environment, make sure that you properly
                installed Borland C++ and that the C compiler tools are
                available from the command line (check with the installation
                notes of Borland C++ on how to do so).
                <p>In addition you need to define the environment variable
                EIF_BORLAND to denote the LIB subdirectory of your Borland
                installation, for example:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>If you installed Borland C++ at this location: D:\BC5<br>
                  Then you should set EIF_BORLAND to D:\BC5\LIB</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>By default the installation program will set in the registry
                keys the ISE_C_COMPILER key to `bcc'.<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Version 5.5
        of the Borland C++ compiler is located on the installation CD of
        EiffelStudio.
                <h2>Borland C++ Builder Users:</h2>
                <p>In the delivery of ISE EiffelStudio you will find all the files
                needed to support Borland C++ Builder 4.0 or higher. C++
                Builder is, however, not a supported environment because of what
                appears to be a bug in the Borland C++ Builder delivery. We are
                sorry about this issue and awaiting an answer from Borland/Inprise
                as to how long it will take to fix the problem.
        <p>In the meantime, we recommend that you either upgrade to Microsoft
                Visual C++ 6.0 or switch to Borland
                C++ 5.5, which is provided on the installation CD of
        EiffelStudio.
                <p>See <a href="#changing">below</a> to learn how to change the
                ISE_C_COMPILER key to use Borland C++ Builder.
                <h2>Cygwin Users:</h2>
                <p>In the delivery of ISE EiffelStudio you will find all the
                needed files to support the GNU gcc port for Windows. However,
                ISE does not support it because of what appears to be a bug in
                the cygwin delivery with the bin utils. We are sorry about this
                issue and awaiting for a fix from the GNU community.
                <p>In the meantime, we recommend that you choose Microsoft
                Visual C++ 6.0 or Borland C++ 4.52 or
                higher.
                <p>See <a href="#changing">below</a> to learn how to change the
                COMPILER key to use GCC.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <h2><a name="changing">Changing your C compiler on Windows</a></h2>
                <p>Simply create a `compiler.reg' file with the following
                content:&nbsp;<center>
                <table>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <td bgColor="#ffffcc">
                        <pre>REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ISE\Eiffel50]

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ISE\Eiffel50\ec]
&quot;ISE_C_COMPILER&quot;=&quot;msc&quot;

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ISE\Eiffel50\finish_freezing]
&quot;ISE_C_COMPILER&quot;=&quot;msc&quot;</pre>
                      </td>
                    </tr>
                  </tbody>
                </table>
                </center>
                <p>Where you can replace &quot;msc&quot; (for Microsoft Visual
                C++) by either:
                <ul>
                  <li>bcc for Borland C++
                  <li>bcb for Borland C++ Builder
                  <li>gnu for GCC
                </ul>
                <p>Then double click on the file and everything will be ready to
                use your new C compiler.</p>
