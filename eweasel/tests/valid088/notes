A class has a secret procedure with a precondition which references a
secret attribute.  This procedure is available to {ANY} as a creation
procedure.  The compiler should report a VAPE violation but it accepts
the class.  Actually, I believe that VAPE may need to be extended to
say that "every feature whose final name appears in any
Assertion_clause is also available to every class to which `r' is
available for *creation*".  Otherwise, the creation procedure can have
a secret precondition.

Discovered in release 3.2.3b.
