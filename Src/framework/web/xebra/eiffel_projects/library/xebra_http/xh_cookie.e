	name: STRING
		--  Required.  The name of the state information ("cookie") is NAME,
		--  and its value is VALUE.  NAMEs that begin with $ are reserved for
		--  other uses and must not be used by applications.

	value: STRING
		-- The VALUE is opaque to the user agent and may be anything the
		-- origin server chooses to send, possibly in a server-selected
		-- printable ASCII encoding.  "Opaque" implies that the content is of
		-- interest and relevance only to the origin server.  The content
		-- may, in fact, be readable by anyone that examines the Set-Cookie
		-- header.
