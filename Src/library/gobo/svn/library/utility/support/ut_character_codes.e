		"Character codes"

	remark:

		"Character codes are declared as integer constants such as %
		% Lower_a_code: INTEGER is 97 %
		%rather than once functions such as %
		% Lower_a_code is once Result := ('a').code end %
		%This is due to the fact that these character codes need to be %
		%integer constants in order to appear in multi-branch instructions."
