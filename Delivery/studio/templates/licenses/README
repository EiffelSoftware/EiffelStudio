This is the location of the template license files.

License files are located at $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/templates/licenses/*.tpl, and user license
files at $ISE_USER_FILES/studio/templates/licenses/*.tpl. The * represents the license name.

License files must contain the indexing/note clause text and nothing more. They will be validated
using a parse and invalid licenses will not be merged into the associated class. Check the logger
tool for failed merged or other errors related to the loading on license template files.

The license name is extracted using the following methods, in order of priority:
  - From the source text under an indexing term 'licence_id'.
        note
            licence_id: "my_license"
  - From the class' configuration target variables, using 'license_id' or 'LICENSE_ID'
  - Or the default 'default', when the above are not found.

In the case of a license_id resulting in the license name 'my_license' the following
will be attempted to be loaded, in order or priority:		
  - $ISE_USER_FILES/studio/templates/licenses/my_license.tpl
  - $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/templates/licenses/my_license.tpl
