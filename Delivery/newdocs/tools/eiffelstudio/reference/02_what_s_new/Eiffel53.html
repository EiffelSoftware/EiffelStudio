		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
		<h3>Changes</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>In project settings, we now accept a root class without creation 
          procedure.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>Fixed issue with setting of arguments. After restarting 
          EiffelStudio the command line argument contains an extra `]' 
          character.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue with working directories where only the first one ever 
          set was used even if new ones have been set afterwards.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue where generating documentation for all/library cluster 
          would stop during generation without completing.</li>
          <li>Fixed resource leak on Windows 98 and Windows Me.</li>
        </ul>
