		<H1>Compile (and run) menu</H1>
<P>The Compile command (i or I) in the main menu yields the following item menu: </P>
<pre>
	(A) Arguments    : set the arguments.
	(C) F-compile    : (re)compile the C code generated by finalize.
	(Z) Finalize     : finalize the system (discard assertions by default).
	(F) Freeze       : freeze the system.
	(L) Melt         : melt the system.
	(K) Quick melt   : quick melt the system.
	(R) Run          : execute the system.
	(W) W-compile    : (re)compile the C code generated by freeze.
	
	(H) Help         : show list of commands.
	(M) Main         : go back to main menu.
	(Q) Quit         : terminate session.
	(Y) Yank         : yank (save) output of last command to a file.
</pre>

<P>The most common compiling option is L (Melt): recompile the system, melting recent changes. The other compilation possibilities are F (Freeze) and Z (Finalize). After a Freeze you will need to C-compile the result using the W (W-compile) command; similarly, you can C-compile the result of a Finalize using C (F-compile).<BR>
With any of these three compilation modes you will be prompted for the name of an Ace file unless you have called the command with the -ace option along with -loop. You may either select an existing Ace file or use a template, in which case you will be able to edit the template before proceeding, using the platform's default editor (such as vi on Unix and Notepad on Windows).
</P>
		<P CLASS="warning">
		<B>Caution</B>: You cannot select a different project from within ec loop; also,
you cannot select a different Ace file from within the command, although
you may of course change the contents of the Ace (for example by using
an editor in an other window).
		</P>
<P>
The R option (Run) runs the
application. You will be prompted for the arguments if the application
needs any.</P>
