test_name 	create-sub-cluster-bogus-vd30
test_description A system with one cluster preceded by the keyword "all" in the Ace file is compiled, where the cluster does not exist.  The compiler correctly reports a VD01 error (nonexistent cluster path in Ace file). Then the cluster is created with one sub-cluster `sub' which contains the root class.  When compilation is resumed, the compiler reports a bogus VD30 error.
