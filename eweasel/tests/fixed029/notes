A class TEST has an enity of type TEST1 (non-BOOLEAN) as the
Boolean_expression in a conditional instruction.  The compiler
correctly detects the VWBE violation and reports it.  But removing an
inheritance clause from TEST1 and hitting return to retry the
compilation causes the compiler to skip some passes on both TEST and
TEST1.  This omission proves disastrous when the compiler later tries
to freeze the system.

Fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
