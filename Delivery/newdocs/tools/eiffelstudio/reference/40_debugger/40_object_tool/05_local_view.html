<h1>Local view</h1>
<p>The first tree in the <A HREF="00_introduction.html">object tool</a> gives information about
the <A HREF="../30_call_stack_tool/00_introduction.html">current stack element</a>.
Namely, it provides the current value of the parameters that were
passed to the corresponding feature, the value of the local variables, as well
as the value of the Result, if this feature is a function.<p>All objects can be
expanded to see the value of their attributes. They are also pickable, so that
it is possible to drop them onto the <A HREF="10_object_view.html">object view</a> or an editor. It is also
possible to use the <A HREF="20_slice_size_command.html">set slice size command</a> with 
<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/base/reference/kernel/special.html">SPECIAL</a> objects.
