Compatibility Notice:  ** No leading underscore **
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike the other builds from mingw-w64 up to 2010-04-27, these new win64
targetting toolchains do *not* prepend an undersocore to the symbols and
follows the MSVC x64 convention.  Therefore, any of the link libraries
from previous toolchains are incompatible with the ones created by these
new builds.
