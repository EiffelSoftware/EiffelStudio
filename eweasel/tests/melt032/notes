A routine has a precondition.  The body of the routine raises an
exception which is retried by the rescue clause.  When precondition
are monitored and the system is melted, the routine precondition is
incorrectly evaluated again when the retry instruction is executed.
Frozen code works correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
