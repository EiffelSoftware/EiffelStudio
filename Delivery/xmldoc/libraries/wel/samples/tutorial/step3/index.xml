If you click the left mouse button in the client area of the window, the coordinates of the click (Relative to the top left of the client area), will be displayed.

		<paragraph>This system is a demonstration of how to gain access to the client area of a window using a WEL_CLIENT_DC. The creation procedure of the DC takes a WEL_WINDOW as an argument, and in this sample, we pass the MAIN_WINDOW. Using this DC, it is a simple step to output the position of the mouse which is provided as arguments to on_left_button_down.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>on_right_button_down has also been redefined to call invalidate which clears the client area of the window.
