		<P>The diagram tool replaces the ISE product EiffelCase. It has been integrated into eiffelstudio to improve the speed of switching between the programming environment and the case tool. Any change you make to the diagram is now reflected in the class texts immediately and can be compiled and tested to reduce bugs. Where EiffelCase required <I>reverse engineering</I> of the Eiffel project, the new case tool is automatically synchronized every time a compilation is successful.</P>

		<P>Use the diagram tool to design new Eiffel systems, or create <A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/products/bon.html">BON</A> (Business Object Notation) diagrams of existing ones. The tool provides you with lots of features to manage different views of the Eiffel system, or parts of it.
