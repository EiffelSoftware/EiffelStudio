After initial compilation, the Ace is changed to indicate a new root
class, which happens to be generic.  The compiler detects the VSRT(1)
error.  But when the Ace is changed to indicate a new (and newly
added) root cluster with a valid root class the compiler reports a
bogus VSCN error.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
