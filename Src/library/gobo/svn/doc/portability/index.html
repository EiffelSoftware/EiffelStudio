<p>One of the main concerns that has driven the design and
implementation of the Eiffel library classes contained in <em>Gobo
Eiffel</em> package was to make the code compilable by as many
Eiffel compilers available on the market as possible. This
implies that the users of this package shouldn't have to modify
any of the Eiffel classes in order to compile them with their
favorite compiler. In particular, no modification should be
necessary in the library classes provided with the compilers,
such as the kernel library classes. This latter requirement is
quite important since a simple modification in a kernel class
such as <font color="#008080"><em><tt>ANY</tt></em></font> or <font
color="#008080"><em><tt>ARRAY</tt></em></font> by just adding or
renaming a feature may invalidate a lot of already existing code
based on these classes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, thanks to the kernel library standard <font
size="2">ELKS '95 </font><font size="3">adopted by </font><font
size="2">NICE</font><font size="3"> (Nonprofit International
Consortium for Eiffel), one can now rely on a set of standard
classes and features to achieve interoperability between Eiffel
compilers. At least, this is the theory. In practice, none of the
Eiffel compilers available on the market are 100% compliant to </font><font
size="2">ELKS '95</font><font size="3">, and the standard itself
is not bulletproof yet. As a consequence, kernel classes provided
with the different compilers have to be adapted to get a minimum
of compatibility between classes from different vendors. Since
these classes cannot be directly modified (see requirement
above), the necessary adaptation is achieved with a combination
of the three following techniques:</font></p>

<p>A non-exhaustive list of <a href="portability.html">portability
issues</a> encountered during the development of this package,
along with the corresponding solutions which have been adopted,
will help to understand some of the design and implementation
decisions which have been made. Hopefully this list will also be
useful to those of you who want to develop portable Eiffel class
libraries. Feel free to contact <a

some of the items from this list or if you experienced other
interoperability problems.</p>
