test_name 	 big-manifest-array-of-strings
test_description A system has a class which creates a manifest array of strings with 25000 elements.  The system compiles fine when frozen, but when executed it dies with a run-time panic while creating the manifest array.  Turning off garbage collection allows the system to execute correctly.
