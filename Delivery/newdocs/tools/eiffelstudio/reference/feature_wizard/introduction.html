		<P>The feature wizard is a window that lets you create simple Eiffel features using the coding standards described in <A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/oosc.html">Object-Oriented Software Construction, Second Edition</A>. It takes away the drag of writing set-procedures for attributes and finding the right feature clause in your class text. The feature wizard can be invoked whenever you have a class open in a development window. It is also used by the diagram tool when creating a client-supplier link.
