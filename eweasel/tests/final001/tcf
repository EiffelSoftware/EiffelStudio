test_name 	finalize-expanded-not-equal
test_description A class has two functions which each have the same expanded type as return type.  One of the functions just lets Result get set by the default initializations applied to locals, while the other one does an explicit creation with Result as target.  The two functions return results which should be equal but are not, but only if the system is finalized.
