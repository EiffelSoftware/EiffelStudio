RELEASE NOTES FOR UNIXWARE VERSION

This note does not apply to any version other than Unixware.

1) Limitation of the process memory
-----------------------------------

Under csh, type `limit' to display the limits associated with the current
user. `limit -h' display the limits built in the Unix kernel.

If the maximum memory is limited, use the "System Tuner" (in the Admin
Tools folder) to set the value to unlimited:

In the process limit parameter section, modify the values for SVMMLIM
and HVMMLIM to 0x7FFFFFFF (unlimited).
