<h1>Introduction to Eiffel for .NET</h1>

<p>This section focuses on defining the first version of Eiffel for .NET. The
key requirement for Eiffel for .NET is the exclusive use of the common language runtime
with a minimum Eiffel-specific runtime. The second requirement is to generate IL
code that is CLS compliant, meaning that other CLS compliant 
languages/compilers/tools will be able to reuse .NET components written in 
Eiffel.NET. The last requirement is to generate verifiable IL code.</p>
<p>Because not all Eiffel functionalities are present in .NET, the task of the 
Eiffel compiler is made more complicated since it has to emulate those 
mechanisms instead of reusing what .NET provides. For example .NET does
not support:</p>
<ul>
  <li>multiple inheritance</li>
  <li>genericity</li>
  <li>covariance</li>
  <li>agents</li>
</ul>
<p>We will see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to access .NET classes.</li>
  <li>which Eiffel mechanisms have been
implemented and which haven't.</li>
</ul>
