CECIL multithreaded example, for ISE Eiffel 4.5 and later

DESCRIPTION
	This program launch two types of threads: the spenders withdraw some money
	from a shared bank acccount while the savers make some deposits on it.
	The Eiffel Threads are launched from C. The synchronization is done
	from Eiffel. The shared bank account is a C structure, and is updated
	by the Eiffel Threads using C externals.
	This is a good example of interaction between C and Eiffel.

	In main.c:
	LISTSZ size of bank account history.
	DEPOSITORS numbers of savers.
	WITHDRAWERS numbers of spenders.

COMPILATION
	You can comment or not the `precompiled' option in the default clause of
	the Ace file. With a precompiled library the system will not be optimized.

	From estudio: open a new project in this directory, choose the proper
	ace file (unix.ace, linux.ace, win.ace depending on your platforms), and	
	then select Compile>finalize. 

	From a console:
	> ec -finalize -ace platform.win
	where platform can be unix, linux or win.

	The executable name is `tst' and is located in the root cluster: 
	it displays the bank account report every LISTSZ transactions.
	
NOTE
	The example compiles with ISE EiffelBench 4.5 and later.
	The Makefile works only in with a finalized CECIL library.
	On windows, the Makefile only works with MS Visual C++.
	You must rewrite the Makefile for frozen mode and for other Windows
	C compilers.
