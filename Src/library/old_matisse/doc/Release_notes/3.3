		       	---------------------

The changes between EiffelStore 3.2 and 3.3 are the following:

	o New Eiffel type support: class DOUBLE.

	o Nested queries support (see example `nested').

	o 1) Under Sybase database server,
   	class DB_CONTROL introduces the notation
   	of transaction:
      	+  Transaction cannot be started to modify RDBMS schema
         	(allocate REPOSITORY)
      	+ Transaction must be started with a DB_CONTROL.begin to
      	store/delete entries in RDBMS tables.
      	+ Transactions are not necessary to query (DB_SELECTION)
      	tables.

   	o Each time a query is applied on a DB_SELECTION object,
   	a dedicated cursor is given to the `query' operation,  until routine
   	`terminate' is called which releases the cursor.
   	Under ORACLE, the number of concurrently opened cursors
   	is limited to 5. For any change in this limitation, see
   	file $EIFFEL4/library/store/dbms/rdbms/oracle/Clib/oracle.pc
   	since it requires a change in the PRO*C source file and
   	a recompilation of the oracle.a external library.

   	o The value retrieved from a column of type CHAR(n) is
   	the exact same value as the one stored in the database.

	o Sybase stored procedures (class DB_PROC).
	See example `stored_proc'.
