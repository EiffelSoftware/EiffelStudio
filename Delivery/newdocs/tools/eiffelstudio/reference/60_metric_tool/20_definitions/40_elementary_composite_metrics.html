		<H1>Elementary and composite metrics</H1>
        <p>Some
        of our metrics will be elementary and some composite. An
        elementary metric is measured directly from the product or project
        record:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b><a name="Elementary metric">Elementary metric</a></b><a name="Elementary metric:">:<br>
        </a>
        - An <b>elementary product
        metric </b>is a product metric whose values (integers) indicate the
        number of occurrences of a certain pattern in a product.<br>
        - An <b>elementary process metric </b>is a process
        metric whose values reflect measurements drawn directly from project
        records.</P>
        <p>An example of elementary product metric is the
        number of source lines. An example of elementary process metric is the
        number of incremental compilations of a system.</p>
        <p>Elementary metrics are provided by default by the metric tool. There
        is no means to remove them or to define new of them since they must be
        implemented to be reached.</p>
        <p>From
        these elementary metrics we may define composite ones:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b><a name="Composite metric">Composite metric</a></b>:
        A <b>composite metric </b>is
        a metric whose values are defined by a mathematical formula involving
        other metrics (elementary, or previously defined composite metrics).</P>
        A later section will introduce a number of
        operations for defining composite metrics out of elementary ones.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again
        we may distinguish between product and process:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b>Composite product metric,
        composite process metric:</b><br>
        - A <b>composite product
        metric </b>is a composite metric defined entirely in terms of product
        metrics.<br>
        A <b>composite process
        metric </b>is a composite metric whose definition involves one or more
        process metrics.</P>
        <p>By
        convention, this definition treats as process metric a composite metric
        involving both product and process components.</p>
        <p>The
        classification introduced for metrics extends to measures, so that we
        may talk about an elementary product measure, a composite process
        measure and so on.</p>
        <p>The metric menu of the metric tool separates elementary and composite
        metrics:&nbsp;</p>

        <p>All metrics (elementary and composite) are not always sensitive at a
        given time. Their sensitiveness depends on also on <a href="70_scopes_scope_types.html">scopes</a></p>
