?MAKE:make_set_make : Loc rm sed make
?MAKE:	-pick add $@ %<
?S:make_set_make:
?S:	Some versions of 'make' set the variable MAKE.  Others do not.
?S:	This variable contains the string to be included in Makefile.SH
?S:	so that MAKE is set if needed, and not if not needed.
?S:	Possible values are:
?S:	make_set_make='#'		# If your make program handles this for you,
?S:	make_set_make="MAKE=$make"	# if it doesn't.
?S:	I used a comment character so that we can distinguish a
?S:	'set' value (from a previous config.sh or Configure -D option)
?S:	from an uncomputed value.
?S:.
?LINT: extern MAKE
?LINT: change MAKE
?T:maketemp
?X: This test is based on one from an autoconf-generated configure
?X: script. Autoconf stole a lot from Configure, but now it's our
?X: turn to do so... ;-) -- RAM, 21/02/97

?X: Use sed so we don't have a line begining with @echo.  Metaconfig
?X: will think that's a command like @if or @end.

?X: GNU make sometimes prints "make[1]: Entering...", which would confuse us
