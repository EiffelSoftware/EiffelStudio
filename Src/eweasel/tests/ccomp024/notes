A declaration of an external routine declares the external to be a
macro and specifies two include files whose names are delimited only
by white space (no %" or <> bracketing).  If the white space is a tab
instead of a space, only one C include is generated with the two file
names run together, causing the C code not to compile.

Discovered in Release 3.3 beta.
