					Criterion to test whether or not a feature is ancestor of another feature
					
					This criterion will use `data' attribute in every QL_FEATURE candidate object.
					IF a QL_FEATURE candidate is satisfied by this criterion. it's `data' attribute will
					be set with branch id (of type INTEGER)
