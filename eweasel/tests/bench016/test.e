	description:
		"[
			A stress test for SCOOP. The test is designed to put a lot of pressure on the memory allocation
			subsystem (and consequently GC) while keeping the threads busy. To a lesser extent this test
			also exercises the evaluation of wait conditions.
			
			The test sets up several worker groups, which are a set of worker processors centered around
			a queue with tasks to be executed. The tasks are different kinds of matrix operations. Each
			worker is specialized to a certain task, and has to wait for a suitable task via wait conditions.
			
			Once an operation is finished, the worker checks whether there are more operations necessary on a
			task, in which case a new matrix is generated and the task object is put back into the queue.
