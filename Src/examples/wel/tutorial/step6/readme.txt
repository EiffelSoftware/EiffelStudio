IMPORTANT NOTE:

Since some people do not have a C compiler, we provide two different ways
to ask the user line thickness. The first one is based on a window (no C
compiler required) and the second is based on a dialog loaded from the 
resources (a C compiler is required to compile the ressource file).

In order to use the first or second solution, do the following:

Dialog based methode (C compiler required)   : choose "methode1" directory.
	-> with C compiler: choose ace file called "ace.ace"

Window based methode (no C compiler required): choose "methode2" directory.
	-> without C compiler: choose ace file called "ace_with_precompiled.ace".
	   you must have the precompiled version of EiffelBase and WEL

	-> with C compiler: choose ace file called "ace.ace"
