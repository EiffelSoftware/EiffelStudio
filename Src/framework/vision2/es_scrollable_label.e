	update_size
			-- Update size and position of `label' to make sure its left side is stick to the left side of the area
			-- and its width and height match current widget width and height.
		do
				-- Stick left side of the text at left side of the scroll area.

				-- with possible values: left, center, right.
			set_x_offset (0)
				-- The previous instruction has the same effect as this one:
				--      label.set_minimum_width (client_width)
				-- that can also replace the next one. However it seems better to be explicit.
				-- Limit text area width with the client width.
			set_item_width (client_width)
				-- Recompute visible text using current width.
			label.refresh_wrapped_text
				-- Update text area size so that its width matches visible width
				-- and height is either computed label height or the client area height
				-- for short text.
				-- The height needs to be updated to remove any additional space from the previous text.
