			-- `index' [in] specifies position of  member of collection. 
			-- If numeric expression, `index' must be number from 1 to
			-- value of collection's `count' property. If string expression, 
			-- `index' must correspond to `key' argument specified when  member

	add (a_item: ECOM_VARIANT; key: ECOM_VARIANT; before: ECOM_VARIANT; after: ECOM_VARIANT) is
			-- `a_item' [in]. Member to add to collection.
			-- `key' [in]. Optional. Specifies key string that can be used, 
			-- instead of positional index, to access member of collection.
			-- `before' [in]. Optional. Expression that specifies relative position in collection. 
			-- Member to be added is placed in collection before member identified by `before' argument. 
			-- If numeric expression, `before' must be number from 1 to the value of the collection's `count' property. 
			-- If string expression, `before' must correspond to `key' specified when member being referred to 
			-- was added to collection. You can specify `before' position or `after' position, but not both.
			-- `after' [in]. Optional. Expression that specifies relative position in collection. 
			-- Member to be added is placed in collection after member identified by `after' argument. 
			-- If numeric, `after' must be number from 1 to value of  collection's `count' property. 
			-- If string, `after' must correspond to key specified when member referred to was added to collection. 
			-- You can specify `before' position or `after' position, but not both.
