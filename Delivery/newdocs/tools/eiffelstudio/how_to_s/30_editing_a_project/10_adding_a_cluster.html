<h1>Adding a cluster</h1>
It is possible to create new clusters from EiffelStudio. A dialog window
has been designed to help you do so.
<p align="center"><img src="/images/eiffelstudio/dialogs_and_wizards/new_cluster_dialog.png"></img></p>
<p>There are three ways to make this
window appear. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Click <img SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_cluster_color.gif" >
in the <a href="../../reference/05_general_interface_description/30_main_toolbars.html">standard
toolbar</a>.</li>

<li>
Click <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_cluster_small_color.gif"> 
in the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/10_browsing_tools/20_cluster_tool/00_introduction.html">Cluster tool</A>.</li>

<li>
Select <b>New cluster</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.</li>
</ul>
Using this dialog, you can either create a subcluster of an existing cluster or a top-level cluster.
<p>If you decide to create a top-level cluster, you should give it a name and a
path (if the selected path does not exist, it will be created). You can also
choose its basic properties, such as whether it should be a library cluster
and/or a recursive one (being a library cluster implies being recursive).</p>
<p>If you want to create a subcluster, give it a name and select its parent in
the list of available clusters (read-only clusters are not displayed). Giving it
a path is not required. If you do not set a path for a new subcluster, it will be
located by default in a subdirectory of its parent cluster, named after the
subcluster name. This is the recommended way of creating a subcluster (since its
path in the Ace file will be automatically relative to the parent), but it is
not compulsory.</p>
<p>To import an existing cluster, you can also go to the <b>Clusters</b> tab
in the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/25_project_settings/30_clusters.html">
Project Settings dialog</a> and click <b>Add</b>.
Although this solution may be slightly more tedious, it gives access to more options.</p>
