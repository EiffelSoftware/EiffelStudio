After initial compilation, a class TEST2 which is used as an actual
generic parameter (where the corresponding formal generic parameter is
used to declare an attribute) is changed so that it is an expanded
class.  After system recompilation, system execution should call the
creation procedure of TEST2 but it does not.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
