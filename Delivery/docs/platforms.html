    </h2>

<blockquote>

<p>
This version of ISE Eiffel was built using the 2.0.34 version of the kernel using
glibc-2.0.7 and elf format.

</p>

  <p>If you are using an environment as described above you should set the
  PLATFORM environment variable to `<b>linux-glibc</b>'. If you plan to release
  your software on different version of the Linux OS you should statically link
  your application otherwise it may not work as expected on different version of
  the Linux kernel.

</p>

  <h3>`eifid' doesn't return a valid value</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Make sure your machine is configured as a "network" machine and not as a standalone machine even if no network card is installed.
    There should be a valid entry in the "/etc/hosts" file for the local host.<br>

</p>

    <p>Make sure a command like "ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1" is also executed at boot time. If you type /sbin/ifconfig, you should see
    something like:

</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>lo        Link encap:Local Loopback&nbsp;<br>
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Bcast:127.255.255.255  Mask:255.0.0.0<br>

  <h3><br>
 BUG with the backspace key</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Under certain linux configuration, the BackSpace key has a strange behaviour within ebench: it deletes the character before the cursor,
    then moves the cursor to right. This bug hasn't been fixed yet, but there is a workaround. Add these two lines into your .Xdefaults file
    (you may have to perform a "xrdb .Xdefaults" if you don't launch X again after the modification):<br>
    <br>
    ebench*XmText*Translations:	\<br>
    override &lt;Key>osfBackSpace: delete-previous-character() backward-character()

</p>

  </blockquote>
  <h3><br>
 XKeysymDB problem</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You may experience trouble while trying to use the BackSpace key. If so, you have to check that the file
    /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB has the definition of the osf symbols, which should be the case
    if you have installed Motif properly. When you have this file correct, and if you still cannot use the
    BackSpace key, you will have to try the following command:<br>
    <br>
    xmodmap -e "keysym Delete = BackSpace"<br>
    <br>
    Check with your xmodmap man page.<br>
    <br>
    Note that you may want to add this command to your configuration files so that this is done each time you run your X server.<br>
    <br>

<h2>
linux-glibc2.1</h2>

<p>
This delivery has been compiled with the distribution RedHat 6.0 (linux  2.2.5-15, glibc 2.1.1-6).

</p>

<p>
If you are using an environment as described above you should set the PLATFORM
environment variable to `<b>linux-glibc2.1</b>'. If you plan to release your
software on different version of the Linux OS you should statically link your
application otherwise it may not work as expected on different version of the
Linux kernel.

  <p>Otherwise, the rest of the information given for `<a href="#linuxglibc">linux-glibc'</a>

<h1><a name="Windows">Windows</a></h1>

<p>ISE products run smoothly on Windows 95/98/NT/2000. Look at the <a href="papers/c_compilers.html">C
compiler</a> pages to know more about Windows requirements.</p>

<p>Due to the way Windows 95/98 manage the graphical user resources you will
notice sometimes that some icons of EiffelBench, EiffelCase or EiffelBuild will
disappear. This just means that you are running to low on graphical user
resources, closing some applications should fix the problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a name="alpha">Digital Unix</a></h1>

<p>To run ISE Eiffel on this platform, please set your environment variable PLATFORM:
<blockquote>

<p>setenv PLATFORM alpha
</blockquote>

<p>Also, add to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH the path to the Eiffel run-time shared libraries.
<blockquote>

<p>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $EIFFEL4/bench/spec/$PLATFORM/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</blockquote>

<p>You need to have at least a Digital Unix system version 4.0 or higher. The C configuration file uses cc as default compiler.

<p>ISE EiffelBench doesn't support any multithreaded mechanism on Digital Unix. However, you can compile multi-threaded programs using the POSIX libraries,
since ISE Eiffel 4.5 provides with Beta-test multi-threaded run-times.&nbsp;

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>

<h1><a name="SGI">SGI</a></h1>

<p>This release has been compiled on IRIX64 sgi 6.5 with cc.

<p>Please your PLATFORM environment variable to sgi if you are running on sgi 6.x.  This release is not compatible
with sgi-5.x.

<p>&nbsp;

<h1><a name="Solaris24">Solaris 2.4</a></h1>
<p>This note does not apply to any version other than Solaris 2.4.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> C compiler:<br>
    You can not use the C compiler shipped with non development system since it is only used to rebuild the kernel.<br>
If you have installed the SPROcc package, the default location for the C compiler is
    /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc.</li>
      <li> Displaying on another Sun machine: When running the Solaris 2.4 version of EiffelBench on a computer, do not display on another Sun computer running Open Windows.
This may crash the X server on that other computer. This bug occurs somewhat randomly (usually only in the second consecutive execution of EiffelBench) and does not arise
for any platform other than Solaris 2.4.  We have not yet been able to determine what causes it.<br>
<br>
The following do NOT cause any problem:
<br>
	- Running on a Solaris computer and displaying on the same computer (the most common case).
<br>
	- Running on a Solaris computer and displaying on a non-Sun computer.
<br>
	- Executing other tools of the environment, in particular EiffelBuild.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>

<h1><a name="Solaris25+">Solaris 2.5 and greater</a></h1>

<p>This version is the same as the SOLARIS-2.4 release (PLATFORM = solaris)&nbsp;
except in multithreaded mode. Please read the entry concerning Solaris 2.4.

<h2> CRAY unicos-t3d</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Please your PLATFORM environment variable to unicos-t3d if you are running on CRAY unicos-t3d.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This version of ISE Eiffel provides only the run-times located $EIFFEL4/bench/spec/unicos-t3d/lib/. . You will also found
the binary `finish_freezing' to compile the generated C-code in $EIFFEL4/bench/spec/unicos-t3d/bin/.<br>
<br>
To run an Eiffel program on CRAY you need to compile the Eiffel code on another platform. Then, you will be able to compile
the generated C-code by launching `finish_freezing' on CRAY in the &lt;your_system_path>/EIFGEN/F_code .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>PORTABILITY OF GENERATED C CODE</h3>

<p>The frozen C-code (in EIFGEN/W_code) is portable between platforms only if the length of the C integer is the same as the platform where the
C code has been generated. Since an C integer (type int) is 8 bytes length. You need to compile the Eiffel code on a system with the same
length of int. (So far, all the Eiffel compilers are running on platforms with 4-bytes-length-integers.<br>
<br>
The Finalized C code (in EIFGEN/F_code) is fully portable between all the supported platforms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SETTINGS BEFORE LAUNCHING C COMPILATION</h3>

<p>You may have to unset TARGET and use the production compiler before any
compilation, the tests on CRAY have been performed with this settings:
  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
setting the production compiler:<br>
% eval `setpe prod`<br>
<br>
unsetting TARGET:<br>
% unsetenv TARGET<br>
<br>
Updating PLATFORM:<br>
% setenv PLATFORM unicos-t3d<br>
<br>
