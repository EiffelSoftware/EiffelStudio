test_name 	 join-features-invalid-vuex
test_description A class TEST calls (on an entity of type TEST1) a feature which should be exported to it.  The compiler incorrectly rejects the class as violating VUEX(2).  If an export restriction is changed from `{TEST1}' to `{NONE}', which if anything ought to make fewer features exported to TEST, the compiler correctly accepts the classes.
