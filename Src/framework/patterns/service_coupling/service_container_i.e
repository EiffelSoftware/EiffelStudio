	description: "[
		Base implementation for all global and local service containers.
		
		Note: Containers must obey some rules.
		
		* When promoting services must be registed with the global service provider ({SERVICE_HEAP}).
		  Promoting is the act of promoting a service to the highest level possible. This attribute
		  only needs to be respected when using chained containers {SERVICE_CHAINED_CONTAINER}.
		  The global service container may be retrieved using the {SERVICE_CONTAINER_S} service from
		  any service provider {SERVICE_PROVIDER_I}.
		  
		* Services that are not promoted may have a localized versions of the service, if not already
		  proffered. When querying for a service a local service is given priority. Clients are free
		  to query for the global service provider {SERVICE_PROVIDER} or {SERVICE_CONTAINER_I}.
		
		Local service providers should guarenteed querying for {SERVICE_PROVIDER_S} or {SERVICE_CONTAINER_S}
		always will return the global versions of those services!
