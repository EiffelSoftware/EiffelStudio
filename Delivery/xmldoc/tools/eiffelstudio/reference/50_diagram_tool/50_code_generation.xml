		<paragraph>All actions taken in the diagram tool that modify a part of the system are immediately reflected in the Eiffel system. Following is a summary of these actions.</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
			<item>When you create a new class, this is the generated empty class:
				<line_break/> 
				<code/>
			</item>
			<item>When you delete a class, the class file is removed from the disk.</item>
			<item>When you add a parent to a class, the parent is inserted in the existing inheritance clause, 
				<italic>without</italic> any additional ( 
				<code>
					<keyword>undefine</keyword>
				</code>/ 
				<code>
					<keyword>select</keyword>
				</code>/etc.) clauses to solve possible conflicts.
				<line_break/> 
				<code/>
			</item>
			<item>When removing an inheritance link, the entire parent clause is removed, i.e. including any 
				<code>
					<keyword>redefine</keyword>
				</code>/ 
				<code>
					<keyword>undefine</keyword>
				</code>/etc. until the matching 
				<code>
					<keyword>end</keyword>
				</code>.
			</item>
			<item>When creating a client link, a function or attribute is generated by the feature wizard. When creating a function, this code is generated:
				<line_break/> 
				<code/>
			</item>
			<item>If you choose to create an attribute for the client link, and optionally specify to generate a set-procedure and an invariant, the following code will be pasted into the class text:
				<line_break/> 
				<code/>
			</item>
			<item>When removing a client link, only the matching function or attribute is removed. Any additionally generated set-feature or invariant is not removed.</item>
			<item>When removing a cluster, the associated directory is not erased, but the reference to the cluster is removed from the Ace file. At this time, it is not possible to create a cluster using the diagram tool, only to remove one.  </item>
