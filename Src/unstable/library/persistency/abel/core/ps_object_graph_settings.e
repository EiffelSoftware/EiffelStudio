		Documentation of the object graph depth concept:
			Each operation on a repository has a depth parameter. The depth indicates how much of an object should be loaded.
			
			A depth of 1 for example means that only the basic types of an object (Numbers, Booleans and Strings)
			should be loaded/inserted/updated, but no referenced object. A depth of 2 means that, additionally to the basic types,
			all referenced objects  should be loaded/stored as if the repository operation has been called on them with 
			object graph depth 1 (you can already see how to continue this for higher numbers...)
			
			There is a special value for the depth: Object_graph_depth_infinite means that an object has to be loaded completely,
			i.e. that there are no more Void references.
			
			The system's default values are Object_graph_depth_infinite for inserting and reading objects, and a depth of 1 for
			updates and deletions. These default values can be overwritten for a whole repository in {REPOSITORY}.default_object_graph_settings
			
			Note: On some repositories the actual object graph depth will be ignored, and it will always use Object_graph_depth_infinite
			instead.

feature -- Query settings

feature -- Update settings

	update_depth: INTEGER
			-- Object graph depth for updates.
			-- Updates are somewhat special: For depth 1, the system will look at references and update them if they point to another object than before, but it will not
			-- call update on the referenced object. In addition, if an update operation finds a new (= not previously loaded) object, it will insert it
			-- if is_isert_during_update_enabled is True.

	update_last_references: BOOLEAN = True
			-- Should the last (Depth = 1) references be updated?
			-- Note: This only covers the references (-> foreign keys) to objects, not the referenced object itself.

	is_insert_during_update_enabled: BOOLEAN = True
			-- Should the system automatically insert objects which are not present in the database and found during an update?

	custom_insert_depth_during_update: INTEGER
			-- The object graph depth that should be applied to insert an object which is found during an update, but isn't yet in the database.

	throw_error_for_unknown_objects: BOOLEAN
			-- If a new object is found an (is_insert_during_update_enabled = False), should an error be thrown for a new object?

feature -- Deletion settings
