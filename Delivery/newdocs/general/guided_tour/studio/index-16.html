<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527345"></A>So far the project modifications that we have made used the text editor in the Editing Tool. We used graphics, but as a way to reflect system structures, not to build them (<A HREF="index-07.html#46460" CLASS="XRef"><SPAN CLASS="ww-crossref">
&quot;A peek at diagrams&quot;,  page 21</SPAN>
</A>, and subsequent discussions).
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527354"></A>In line with the principles of seamlessness and reversibility recalled at the beginning of this Tour, EiffelStudio's text-diagram interaction is bi-directional. When you make a textual modification, the next incremental recompilation will update the diagram; but you can also work directly from the diagram, and the text will be generated or updated after each graphical operation.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527355"></A>Many people like to use the graphical mechanisms at the beginning of a project, to draft the overall structure of a system in &quot;bubbles-and-arrows&quot; style, then concentrate on text as they get closer to implementation. But there is really no such obligation. At any point in the development, just use the form that is more suited to your taste and to your needs of the moment.

<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527357"></A>We are going to play with the root cluster. Make sure the Cluster tree and the Context Tool are up. Also make sure that the Context tool is in Isolate rather than Merge behavior (<A HREF="index-11.html#89659" CLASS="XRef"><SPAN CLASS="ww-crossref">
&quot;Isolating the context&quot;,  page 68</SPAN>

Edit menu</SPAN>
: if there is an entry <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Isolate context tool</SPAN>

<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527381"></A>The earlier diagrams were &quot;class views&quot;, giving a picture of the world around a class. For a change, we are now going to start working with <SPAN CLASS="ff-bold">

, showing the content of a cluster. Select the Diagram Tab in the Context Tool; from the Cluster Tree, pick-and-drop <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">

 an attribute of type <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">

 to the top Editing Tool to see how the class has been modified. The situation here is different from what we saw earlier with <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
HEIR2</SPAN>
, which had been generated from scratch by the diagram. Here <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
TESTROOT</SPAN>
 existed before, in text form; so the diagram mechanisms have had to preserve the existing feature and feature clauses, and add the elements corresponding to what you have specified through the diagram mechanisms. Here is the beginning of class <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">

my_heir /= Void</SPAN>

<A NAME="pgfId-527647"></A>Nothing happens yet to the diagram. This is normal: EiffelStudio doesn't update the diagram every time you type some text (which, for one thing, might be syntactically incorrect, or invalid). You need to recompile first. Click the <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">

 to it:
<DIV>
<p>

</ul>
<p>

<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527747"></A>As you can see, this dialog also serves to change the name of formal generic parameters when the selected class is generic. Type <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
HEIR1</SPAN>
 (or <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
heir1</SPAN>
, EiffelStudio always converts class names to upper case) under <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
New name</SPAN>
 and click <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
OK</SPAN>
.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527754"></A>As EiffelStudio traverses the system to update all references to <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
HEIR</SPAN>
, a progress bar appears so that you know what's going on. Everything is updated, including the current cluster diagram, which displays the new name in the class bubble:
<DIV>
<p>
<ul>
<A TARGET="screenshots" HREF="index-135.png"><IMG WIDTH="100" SRC="index-135.png"></A>

<A NAME="pgfId-527793"></A>Adjusting the display</H2>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527798"></A>A number of buttons enable you to customize the display:
<DIV>
<p>
<ul>
<A TARGET="screenshots" HREF="index-136.png"><IMG WIDTH="100" SRC="index-136.png"></A>
</ul>
<p>
</DIV>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527797"></A>So far all class bubbles had the same default color (yellow). Try pick-and-dropping a bubble into the <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Color hole</SPAN>
 to get a color palette that enables you to select a different color. This is useful if you want to highlight classes possessing certain properties, for example classes that are part of a certain Design Pattern.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527807"></A><SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Relation depth</SPAN>
 enables you to select the depth at which inter-class relations will be displayed. (Don't change this setting now.) <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Extend to cluster</SPAN>
 is more useful for class diagrams than for the cluster diagram we have now, which by default included all classes of the cluster; if you click it here it will add the class <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
INVALID</SPAN>
 that you removed earlier. There is no need to do this now.<SPAN CLASS="ee-text">

<H2 CLASS="aa-sec3">
<A NAME="pgfId-527806"></A>Views</H2>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527764"></A>So far the top-right <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
View </SPAN>
field has always shown <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
DEFAULT</SPAN>
. You can define any number of views in your project, and apply them to various class and cluster diagrams.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527765"></A>For example, using the buttons to show and hide links of various kinds

</ul>
<p>
</DIV>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527789"></A>you can produce diagrams that only show the inheritance links, and others that only show the client links. If you want to keep both kinds of diagram, simply define views by typing view names -- such as <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
Inheritance</SPAN>
, <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
Client</SPAN>
, <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
All_links</SPAN>
 -- into the <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
View </SPAN>
field.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527808"></A>You can also use views to retain some of the choices seen just before, such as different colors and depths.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527816"></A>To load a previously defined view, just use the menu associated with the <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
View</SPAN>
 field.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-527792"></A>You may remember that when we generated HTML documentation, the dialog (page <A HREF="index.html#DOCUMENTATION VIEW" CLASS="XRef"><SPAN CLASS="ww-crossref">
46</SPAN>
</A>) asked you to select a view among the available ones. You can choose a different view for each cluster.

<A NAME="pgfId-527821"></A>Class diagrams, cluster diagrams</H2>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527822"></A>Whereas our initial encounter with diagrams at the beginning of this Tour used class diagrams, in the present discussion we have used cluster diagrams. Both are interesting. To obtain a class diagram, you will target a Context Tool to a class, and select the <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Diagram</SPAN>
 Tab. By default, this shows the parents of the class. Do this now for <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
TESTROOT</SPAN>
:

</ul>
<p>
</DIV>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-527837"></A>It's for class diagrams that the <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Relation depth </SPAN>
button is most interesting. It will let you select the exact depth that you wish displayed for every relation:
<DIV>
<p>
<ul>
<A TARGET="screenshots" HREF="index-139.png"><IMG WIDTH="100" SRC="index-139.png"></A>

<A NAME="pgfId-527850"></A>This will conclude our review of the Diagram facilities of EiffelStudio, although you'll surely discover some further riches by yourself and through the rest of the documentation. We hope the complete seamlessness between text and pictures will enable you to increase the effectiveness of your analysis work, or your design work, or your programming -- whatever level of system development you need to tackle.
