test_name 	 assign-addr-expr-to-pointer
test_description An assignment whose source is an address expression `$x' (which is of type pointer) and whose target is of type POINTER should be accepted, but the compiler reports a syntax error.  Replacing `$x' with `ptr ($x)', where `ptr' just returns its argument, causes the compiler to accept the class.
