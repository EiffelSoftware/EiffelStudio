		<H1>What was new in EiffelStudio 5.1</H1>
		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Numerous improvements in usability and bug fixes.</li>
          <li>Richer class and cluster creation dialogs.</li>
          <li>Class name completion in the editor (by pressing Shift+Ctrl+Space
            half-way through the class name).</li>
          <li>Editor now supports drag-and-drop of the selection.</li>
          <li>When debugging a project from EiffelStudio, the current directory 
          will be your project directory. It is a change from previous version 
          where:<ul>
          <li>on Windows, it used to be launched in the EIFGEN\W_code of your 
          project directory</li>
          <li>on Unix, it used to be launched from the same directory where 
          `estudio' (or `ebench') was launched.</li>
        </ul>
		  </li>
          <li>EiffelStudio GUI now also available on Unix platforms and Windows 9x/Me</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Compiler and .NET</h2>

          support on .NET</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Libraries</h2>
		<h3>EiffelBase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is now forbidden to create a <span class="eclass">BIT_REF</span> or a <span class="eclass">BIT X</span> object using 
          its creation procedure (before it was accepted but did not work)</li>
          <li>Added <span class="efeature">make_temporary_name</span> in <span class="eclass">FILE_NAME</span></li>
          <li>Made <span class="efeature">to_c</span> obsolete from class <span class="eclass">INTEGER_INTERVAL</span></li>
          <li>Changed semantic of <span class="efeature">split</span> from class <span class="eclass">STRING</span></li>
          <li>Fixed a bug in <span class="efeature">clear_all</span> from <span class="eclass">HASH_TABLE</span> that 
          kept a reference to the last found item. Now it does not keep the 
          reference after a call to <span class="efeature">clear_all</span>.</li>
        </ul>
