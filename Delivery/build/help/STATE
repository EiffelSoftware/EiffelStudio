States
------

A state is the definition of certain behaviors associated with
certain contexts. Since a behavior is itself an association of
certain commands to certain events, another way to express this
definition is to note that a state includes the following elements:

 - A set of contexts
 - For each context, a set of events that can occur within 
   the context
 - For each context and each event applicable to the context,
   a command (which should be executed when the given event
   occurs within the given context)

Every interactive application has at least one state. Most 
applications have several, reflecting the property that at different
stages through a session the context-event combinations available to
the users may be different, and those combinations that are common
may have different effects. The nature of a state is to define the
valid context-event combinations and the associated commands.

Simple applications may be quite happy with just one state. In fact 
it is possible to use EiffelBuild extensively and never to worry
about states. By default there will always be a first state, called
`State1'.

You can create new states by pressing the left most hole in the
application editor, or by dragging one of the states shown in the 
application editor and drop it on the drawing area of the editor.
A transition between two states can be created by dragging and dropping
the source of transition to the target.

When you select a state by clicking on its name in the `State'-field 
of the application editor the state will be highlighted and the 
`Transition'-field will show the list of transition labels that have
been defined for the commands in that state.
