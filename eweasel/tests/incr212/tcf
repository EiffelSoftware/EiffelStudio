test_name 	 c-inline-change-arg-order
test_description After initial compilation, an external routine which is "C inline" has the order of its formal arguments changed.  When changes are melted, system execution produces the wrong output (same output as before). Looks like the compiler needs to freeze when any changes are made to the list of formal argument names.

define ARG_NAMES "n1, n2, n3"
copy_sub 	Ace $TEST Ace
copy_sub 	test.e $CLUSTER test.e

execute_work	 NONE exec_output1
