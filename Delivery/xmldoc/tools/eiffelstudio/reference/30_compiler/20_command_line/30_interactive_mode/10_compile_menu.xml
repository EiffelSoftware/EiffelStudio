	(A) Arguments    : set the arguments.
	(C) F-compile    : (re)compile the C code generated by finalize.
	(Z) Finalize     : finalize the system (discard assertions by default).
	(F) Freeze       : freeze the system.
	(L) Melt         : melt the system.
	(K) Quick melt   : quick melt the system.
	(R) Run          : execute the system.
	(W) W-compile    : (re)compile the C code generated by freeze.

	(H) Help         : show list of commands.
	(M) Main         : go back to main menu.

		<paragraph>The most common compiling option is L (Melt): recompile the system, melting recent changes. The other compilation possibilities are F (Freeze) and Z (Finalize). After a Freeze you will need to C-compile the result using the W (W-compile) command; similarly, you can C-compile the result of a Finalize using C (F-compile). With any of these three compilation modes you will be prompted for the name of an Ace file unless you have called the command with the -ace option along with -loop. You may either select an existing Ace file or use a template, in which case you will be able to edit the template before proceeding, using the platform's default editor (such as vi on Unix and Notepad on Windows).</paragraph>
		<warning>
			<bold>Caution</bold>: You cannot select a different project from within ec loop; also, you cannot select a different Ace file from within the command, although you may of course change the contents of the Ace (for example by using an editor in an other window).
		</warning>
		<paragraph>The R option (Run) runs the application. You will be prompted for the arguments if the application needs any.</paragraph>
