A routine has a local of an expanded type, where the base class of
this type has a creation procedure that raises an exception.  If the
system is melted, the recipient of the exception is not the routine
containing the declaration of the local but that routine's caller.  If
the system is frozen, the routine containing the declaration of the
expanded local is the recipient of the exception.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
