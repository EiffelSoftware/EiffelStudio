		<paragraph>This system is a demonstration of how to connect an event to one of the common message hooks available within WEL. See 
			<link>
				<url>/libraries/wel/content/common_concepts/index.html#common_message_hooks</url>
				<label>Common message hooks</label>
			</link> for more information. In this example, on_left_button_down has been redefined from WEL_WINDOW to display a WEL_MSG_BOX containing notification of the event occuring. 
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>If you look at closeable from MAIN_WINDOW, you will see that it has been redefined to display a WEL_MSG_BOX and the result from this message box is used to generate the return value of closeable. If this Result is True, the window will be closed.
