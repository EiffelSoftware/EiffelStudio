After initial compilation, an attribute used as an anchor in a type
serving as actual generic parameter is changed to a procedure.  When
the system is recompiled, the compiler incorrectly reports a VTCG
error (which is impossible since the involved generic class has no
generic constraints) instead of a VTAT(1) error.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
