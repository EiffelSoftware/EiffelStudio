	description:

		"Test for validity rule VQMC-3"

	remark: "[
		In this test the binary integer constant '0b100000000' (i.e. 256) in
		'cc: INTEGER_8 = 0b100000000' is too big to be representable as an INTEGER_8.

		This rule is in ECMA 367-2, section 8.18.2, p.100.
		ISE reports that the type of 256 is INTEGER_32 and hence does not match
		the declared type INTEGER_8. This is not quite what ECMA 367-2 expects.
