A system has a debug instruction with every character except null in
its debug key.  When the system is melted, the debug instruction is
not executed, although it should be.  Freezing produces C code that
won't compile.  Finalizing produces code that compiles and executes
correctly.

Discovered in Release 5.0.016.
