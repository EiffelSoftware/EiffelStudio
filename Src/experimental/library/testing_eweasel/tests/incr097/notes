A class with a generic parameter `G -> ARRAY [like weasel]' is
correctly reported as a VCFG(3) error.  But when an empty line is
inserted and then deleted in the file containing the class, thereby
updating its date of last modification, and compilation is resumed the
compiler terminates silently after pass 5 on the class.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
