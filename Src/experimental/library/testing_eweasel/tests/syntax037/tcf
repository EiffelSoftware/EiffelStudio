test_name 	 cast-arg-type-with-parens
test_description An external routine has a Special_external_decl which casts the arguments.  If the type to which an argument is cast includes any parentheses, then the first closing parentheses in the cast type incorrectly terminates the argument list in parentheses.  This causes the compiler to report a syntax error.
