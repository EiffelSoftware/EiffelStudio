		<h1>Using Referenced Assemblies</h1>
		<P>Eiffel for .NET is a first class citizen in the Microsoft .NET programming 
			world. This means that if you are programming in Eiffel for .NET, say with 
			ENViSioN!, you have full access to the thousands of software components in the 
			.NET type libraries. But, that's not all. You also have full access to the 
			thousands of components in the traditional Eiffel class libraries. And even 
			that's not all. You have the ability to build software components which comply 
			with .NET standards, so that they can be used by programmers using any other 
			.NET language. Still not all. When you use Eiffel, you can choose to build 
			software that will run under Microsoft .NET, but will be portable to other 
			popular operating systems as well.
		</P>
		<p>Being an Eiffel for .NET programmer obviously put you in a very powerful 
			position. How do you take advantage of it?
		</p>
		<p>To use .NET software components from Eiffel for .NET requires you to have some 
			understanding of both .NET and Eiffel and how their respective object models 
			differ. If you have read the rest of the help topics in <A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/20_Language/10_Eiffel_for_NET.htm">
				this section</A> then you have a pretty good idea of what the Eiffel method 
			and language are all about.
		</p>
		<p>When you begin to build software in Eiffel for .NET, you will likely find a need 
			to reuse types from the .NET libraries. These libraries are called assemblies. 
			When you reference a assembly using Eiffel for .NET, the types in the assembly 
			become available to you in a form that makes them look like so many Eiffel 
			classes. The names for types and members will conform to Eiffel conventions. 
			The same thing happens when you are programming against assemblies in Visual 
			Basic .NET or Visual C# .NET.</p>
		<p>The section called <A href="../10_conventions/00_introduction.html">Conventions</A>
			covers the details the Eiffel conventions and how the .NET types are made 
			available to Eiffel for .NET programmers.
