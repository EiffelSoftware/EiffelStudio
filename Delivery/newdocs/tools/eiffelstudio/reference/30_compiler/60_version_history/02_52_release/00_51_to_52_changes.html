<p>&nbsp;</p>



        <H2>What's new</H2>
        
        <UL>
        
        <LI>.NET generation now includes support for the following language 
        features:<UL>
        
        <li>Support for multiple inheritance.</li>
        
        <li>Support for 
        generics.</li>
        
        <li>Partial implementation of generic conformance </li>
        
        <li>Support for tuples and 
        agents.</li>
        
        <li>Support for any existing Eiffel code that does not use C 
        externals.</li>
        
        <li>Support for compiling Eiffel libraries using C 
        externals that are not related to the ISE C runtime.</li>
        </UL>
        
        <p>And the following limitations:<UL>
        
        <li>Eiffel classes cannot inherit from non-Eiffel .NET classes (but they 
        can be clients).</li>
        
        <li>No support for `expanded' keyword.</li>
        </UL>
        
        <li>.NET generation now supports assembly signing in enterprise edition.</li>
        <li>.NET generation now supports precompiled libraries.</li>
        <li>Supports for manifest integer constants of different sizes, i.e. you 
        can now assign for example the value `8' to a location of type INTEGER_8, 
        INTEGER_16, INTEGER or INTEGER_64, however you can only assign the value 
        `254' to a location of type INTEGER_16, INTEGER or INTEGER_64.</li>
        </UL>
        
        <H2>Improvements</H2>
        
        
        <UL>
        
        <LI>Compiler that is about 20% faster than 5.1.<LI>Runtime is about 
        10-20% faster than 5.1</UL>
        
        
        <h2>Bug fixes</h2>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed memory corruption issue when trying to access an INTEGER_64 
          value.</li>
          <li>Fixed a problem with manifest INTEGER_64 constants whose values 
          were incorrectly interpreted.</li>
          <li>Fixed VAPE errors that were not previously reported in 5.1. Now VAPE 
          errors are checked against call to infix and prefix features.</li>
</ul>
