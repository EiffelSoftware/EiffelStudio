test_name 	melted-profinfo-wrong-dir
test_description A system whose Ace specifies `profile (yes)' is melted.  When the system is executed with the EIFGEN/W_code directory as the current directory with the MELT_PATH environment variable not set, system execution attempts to create the "profinfo" file in the wrong place (not in the EIFGEN/W_code directory).
