An assignment to a feature which is a function violates VJAW.  When
this function takes no arguments, the compiler reports VJAW.  But when
the feature which is the target of the assignment takes arguments, the
compiler incorrectly reports a VUAR(1) error.  This cannot be correct
since no feature calls are involved in the instruction.  An attempt to
add arguments to the feature produces a syntax error.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
