<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p align="center"><img src="../../../../../images/eiffelstudio/debugger/expression_evaluation_tool.png"></img></p>
<p align="left">The expression evaluation tool makes it possible to evaluate expressions
while the application is stopped. A typical use for it is if you would like to
know the result an external feature would return. Since you do not have access
to the C memory of the application, doing this is impossible. You may also want
to know the result of an Eiffel feature whose body is too complex for you to
evaluate.</p>
<p>In these cases (and any other that suits you), you should use the dynamic
expression evaluation. Simply <A HREF="20_new_expression_dialog.html">define the expression</a> and its result will be
immediately available in the <A HREF="10_expression_list.html">list of expressions</A>.</p>

<p class="warning"><b>Caution</b>: During the evaluation of an expression, all features that are
necessary to obtain the result are called. Therefore, you should avoid calling
queries that have side-effects, since doing so may alter the program execution.
The Eiffel methodology recommends not to define side-effects queries anyway.</p>
