A class FOO inherits a generic class twice providing different actual
generic parameters and renaming the single routine `f' in the generic
class.  Routine `f' creates a local of type G and prints its
generating type.  The root class creates an instance of FOO and calls
both versions of `f'.  the system compiles fine, but produces the
wrong results when executed.
