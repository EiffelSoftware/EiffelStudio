Class A has an operator feature exported only to itself and its
descendants.  When class B (which is not a descendant of class A)
tries to call this feature, the compiler should report a VUEX(2)
error.  Instead, it accepts the invalid classes.  If the feature is an
identifier feature, the compiler correctly reports VUEX(2).

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
