					Abort a suspended Eiffel compilation so that another
					compilation can be started from scratch.  There can be at most
					one Eiffel compilation in progress at a time.  This
					instruction does a `cleanup' after aborting the compilation,
					which deletes the entire EIFGENs/test directory tree.
