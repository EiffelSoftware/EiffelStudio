After initial compilation, a VEEN error is added to a class.  When the
compiler detects the error, it is corrected by inheriting from a
different class.  This introduces a VRFA error which the compiler
catches, but it also says "Exception occurred while displaying error
message" while trying to display the name of the feature involved.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
