A class declares a local of type `FOO [expanded DOUBLE]' where FOO is
a generic class with a single formal generic parameter constrained by
DOUBLE.  A routine of the generic class assigns something of type
`Generic #1' to something of type DOUBLE.  The system compiles fine,
but dies with an "illegal metamorphose type" panic when executed.  If
the system is frozen, the C code for the generic class won't compile.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
