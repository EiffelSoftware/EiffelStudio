After initial compilation, the root class is changed to a generic
class by adding a single formal generic parameter.  When the system is
recompiled, the compiler detects the VSRC violation but first does
pass 1 twice on the root class.  After the problem is corrected by
removing the formal generic parameter, the compiler again does pass 1
twice.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
