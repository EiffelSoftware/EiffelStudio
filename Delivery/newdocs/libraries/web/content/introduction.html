	    <h2>CGI Applications</h2>
	    <p>The way a CGI application communicates with the Web browser is simple: when the
user presses a button on an HTML form, with an associated action (such as
<i>Submit</i>), the browser starts the application whose path is indicated inside
        the HTML form declaration. It sends data corresponding to the HTTP request and
to the input form information in the usual file descriptor <i>In</i>, stores within
environment variables the transaction environment of the request, and waits for
the application message, expected in its  <i>Out</i> canal. The <i>In</i> and <i>
        Out </i>canals are accessible via the class
        <a class="eclass" href="../../../../../../../../libraries/web/reference/cgi_facilities/cgi_in_and_out.html">CGI_IN_AND_OUT</a>.<br>
<br>
HTML forms are an easy way to collect user entries in a web page, which are sent
by the browser to the CGI application. A simple example of a form is:<p>
<code>
&lt;form action=&quot;/cgi-bin/convert.exe&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;Celsius&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;<br>
&lt;/form &gt;</code></p>
	    <p>When the user presses the submit button, the browser will launch the application
located at <i>/cgi-bin/convert.exe</i> on the server, will use the HTTP Post
protocol, and will store among others the environment variable <i>Celsius</i> with
the value entered by the user.</p>
	    <h2>Advantages of using EiffelWeb</h2>
	    <p>With EiffelWeb, you can:</p>
	    <ul>
          <li>Design object-oriented systems </li>
          <li>Access and use the Eiffel libraries</li>
          <li>Increase maintainability because your code is reusable and readable</li>
          <li>Deal with complexity because you use a language particularly efficient
in the Business Modeling.</li>
          <li>Use
one/a few big Eiffel Web applications, which allow for an easier maintenance and provide
          better code readability and reusability than having a huge number of
          scripts.</li>
          <li>Use the <i>Design by Contract</i> methodology, thanks to the debugging
facilities provided by EiffelWeb.</li>
        </ul>
