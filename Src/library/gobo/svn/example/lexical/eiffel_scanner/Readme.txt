This directory contains the source code for a simple Eiffel scanner.
It uses Gelex to generate class EIFFEL_SCANNER.

Class EIFFEL_SCANNER has three creation procedures. `make' just creates
a scanner. `execute' creates a scanner and scans the files given in the 
command line, one by one. `benchmark' expects the command line to be made
up of a number 'nb' followed by a filename. It creates a scanner and scans
'nb' times the file given as second argument.

Note: This Eiffel scanner is just a simple example. It is not intended
to be perfect or to follow any Eiffel syntax standard. Moreover, it does
not generate any output. A full-fledged Eiffel scanner is provided in
the Gobo Eiffel Tools Library in $Gobo/library/tools/eiffel/parser/.

To compile this example:

1. Use the script 'geant scanner' to generate class EIFFEL_SCANNER
   if necessary.

2. Choose either `execute' or `benchmark' as the creation procedure of
   the root class EIFFEL_SCANNER in your Ace, Xace or ECF file.

3. Use your favorite Eiffel compiler to compile the Eiffel system using
   the provided Ace, Xace or ECF file (e,g, <compiler>.ecf). Alternatively
   you can use 'geant' to launch the compilation:
   
       geant compile_<compiler>
       
   where <compiler> is either 'ise' or 'ge'.

4. Execute the Eiffel scanner using

       eiffel_scanner filename1 ...

   if you selected `execute' as creation procedure, or

       eiffel_scanner nb filename

   if you selected `benchmark', where `filename', `filename1', etc. are
   filenames containing Eiffel classes and `nb' is an integer.
