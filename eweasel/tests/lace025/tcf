test_name 	 visible-cluster-case-sensitive
test_description A Visible clause in the Ace which names a class (or a feature in its export subclause) is case-sensitive if the name is enclosed in double quotes, but should not be since it does not refer to an outside element.  The compiler incorrectly reports a VD25 violation.  In the case of a feature, the compiler thinks the feature is missing so it dies (a previously reported bug).
