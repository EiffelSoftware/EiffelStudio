A system without a needed cluster is compiled without precompilation
info.  When the compiler correctly detects the VTCT error, the kernel
cluster is removed and compilation is resumed.  The VD23 error is
detected.  But when the kernel cluster is added back to the Ace, along
with the missing needed cluster and compilation is resumed again, the
compiler dies with an exception trace.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
