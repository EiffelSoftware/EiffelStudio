After initial compilation, a new attribute is added to a parent of a
class containing a `strip' expression.  After recompilation, system
execution produces the wrong output (different than the output of a
system compiled from scratch).  The initial compilation and
recompilation can each be either a melt or a freeze - the problem
occurs regardless.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
