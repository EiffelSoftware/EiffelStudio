		<P>[BENCH] editor now offers the possibility to complete feature calls automatically. This means that
		when the user types &quot;<i>an_identifier.an_incomplete_feature_name</i>&quot; and then triggers the autocomplete, the
		editor will propose a list of possible feature names correct in this situation.<BR>To be more
		precise, a window will pop up and display the list of features that can be called on
		<i>an_identifier</i>. In this list, the first name that matches <i>an_incomplete_feature_name</i> will
		be highlighted. The user can accept the suggested name, choose another name (in the list or not), or simply
		cancel the auto-complete.
		</P>
		SCREENSHOT (autocomplete window)
		<P>To trigger the autocomplete, press the key combination &quot;Ctrl+Space&quot; or click on
		<B>Complete word</B> in the <B>Advanced</B> sub-menu of the <B>Edit</B> menu. If automatic completion is
		possible, a window will appear. This window will contain a text field and a list. The text field will be
		filled with the beginning of the feature name you entered. The first item that matches in the list, if
		any, will be selected.<BR>
		To complete your code with the selected item, press &quot;Enter&quot; or &quot;Ctrl+Space&quot;.<BR>
		To choose another item, use keyboard Up and Down arrows or the mouse. You can also modify the
		content of the text field. The selected item will be updated automatically. To validate your choice,
		press &quot;Enter&quot; or &quot;Ctrl+Space". If there is no selected item, the content of the text field
		will be inserted.<BR>
		To cancel the autocomplete, press &quot;Esc&quot; at any time.
