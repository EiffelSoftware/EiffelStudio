# Semantics M1IE

This [test](.) is exercising the semantics rule [`M1IE`](../Readme.md).

### Description

In this test, we have an inequality expression of the form `c /= d` where `c` and `d` are both reference entities. `c` is attached to an object of type `INTEGER_8`, and `d` is attached to an object of type `CHARACTER_8`. The value of this expression is true because the objects are with copy semantics but they don't have the same type.
