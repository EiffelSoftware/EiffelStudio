Finalizing a system with an Ace which specifies both
`dead_code_removal (no)' and `array_optimization (yes)' causes the
compiler to die while generating `eplug.c'.  Finalizing with the -keep
option to retain assertions suppresses dead code removal so it also
causes the compiler to die if array optimization is on.

Discovered in Release 3.3.3.
