	<paragraph>
		CodeDom stands for the <bold>Code Document Object Model</bold>. CodeDom allows for representing source code
		 in an abstract data structure. Such a representation is called a <bold>CodeDom tree</bold> as the underlying data
		 structure uses a tree paradigm. This abstract representation can then be generated into different
		 programming languages. Each language vendor provides its implementation of the CodeDom interfaces,
		 this implementation is called a <bold>CodeDom Provider</bold>. Programmers can then build tools that 
		can work with many different languages without having to know about each one, instead they just delegate
		 code generation to each CodeDom Provider. 
		
		<paragraph>
			The CodeDom interfaces also expose types and methods that
			 allow for parsing source code and creating the corresponding CodeDom. The current implementation of
			 the Eiffel CodeDom Provider does not support parsing. Code generation is a much more popular useage
			 of the CodeDom and the current version focuses on this aspect of the technology.
