In the Undefine, Redefine and Select inheritance subclauses, ETL does
not address the case where `fname' is the final name in C of more than
one feature inherited from B, due to renaming.  How can one merge two
features inherited from the same class, one of which is effective and
the other deferred, and have the resulting feature be deferred?

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
