		<paragraph>EiffelStudio editor now offers the possibility to complete feature calls automatically. This means that when the user types"
			<italic>an_identifier.an_incomplete_feature_name</italic>" and then triggers the auto-complete, the editor will propose a list of possible feature names correct in this situation.
			<line_break></line_break>To be more precise, a window will pop up and display the list of features that can be called on 
			<italic>an_identifier</italic> and that match
			<italic>an_incomplete_feature_name</italic>. The user can accept the suggested name, choose another name (in the list or not), or simply cancel the auto-complete.

			</link>. If automatic completion is possible, there are two cases : if only one name matches, this name will be inserted in the editor. If there are no matching names or several ones a window will appear. This window will contain a text field and a list. The text field will be filled with the beginning of the feature name that was entered. The first item in the list, if any, will be selected.
			<line_break></line_break> To complete your code with the selected item, press "Enter" or "Ctrl+Space".
			<line_break></line_break> To choose another item, use keyboard Up and Down arrows or the mouse. You can also modify the content of the text field. The list will be updated automatically. To validate your choice, press "Enter" or "Ctrl+Space". If there is no selected item, the content of the text field will be inserted.
			<line_break></line_break> To cancel the auto-complete, press "Esc" at any time.
