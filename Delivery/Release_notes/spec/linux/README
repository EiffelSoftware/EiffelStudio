RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX VERSION

This note does not apply to any version other than Linux ELF format. 

This version of ISE Eiffel was built using the 2.0.30 version of the kernel
using libc5 and elf format.

0) PLATFORM environment variable
--------------------------------

Please note that the PLATFORM environment variable is now linux instead of
linux-elf.


1) Glibc
--------

This release is compatible with both the GNU C library based Linux systems
and libc5 based systems. The glibc systems has to have libc5 libraries to be
able run the executables. If you develop under a glibc system, your
applications will be using the GNU C libary.

GLIBC USERS:
Please check the directories
$EIFFEL5/bench/spec/$PLATFORM/include/glibc and
$EIFFEL5/bench/spec/$PLATFORM/lib/glibc

Check also
$EIFFEL5/library/mel/spec/$PLATFORM/lib/glibc
for MEL

and
$EIFFEL5/library/net/spec/$PLATFORM/lib/glibc
for EiffelNet

2) `eifid' doesn't return a valid value
---------------------------------------

Make sure your machine is configured as a "network" machine and not as a
standalone machine even if no network card is installed.

There should be a valid entry in the "/etc/hosts" file for the local host.

Make sure a command like "ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1" is also executed at
boot time. If you type /sbin/ifconfig, you should see something like:

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Bcast:127.255.255.255  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP BROADCAST LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:3584  Metric:1
          RX packets:1050 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0
          TX packets:1050 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0


3) BUG with the backspace key
-----------------------------

Under certain linux configuration, the BackSpace key has a strange
behaviour within ebench: it deletes the character before the cursor,
then moves the cursor to right. This bug hasn't been fixed yet, but
there is a workaround. Add these two lines into your .Xdefaults file
(you may have to perform a "xrdb .Xdefaults" if you don't launch X
again after the modification):

ebench*XmText*Translations:	\
override <Key>osfBackSpace: delete-previous-character() backward-character()


4) XKeysymDB problem
--------------------

You may experience trouble while trying to use the BackSpace key.
If so, you have to check that the file /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB
has the definition of the osf symbols, which should be the case
if you have installed Motif properly.
When you have this file correct, and if you still cannot use the
BackSpace key, you will have to try the following command:

xmodmap -e "keysym Delete = BackSpace"

Check with your xmodmap man page.

Note that you may want to add this command to your configuration
files so that this is done each time you run your X server.
