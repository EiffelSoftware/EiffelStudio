		<H1>Running an application</H1>
        <p>There are several ways to launch an application. Not all are
        available depending on the way you compiled your system.</p>

        <p>Melted and frozen executables can be debugged. Several methods can be
        used to launch such an executable:</p>

		<UL>
			<LI>The default <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/40_debugger/10_execution/10_run_and_debug.html">
				<b>Run</b> command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_debug_run_color.gif"></a>.
              It launches the executable located in the EIFGEN|W_code directory
              under the project directory. The execution stops whenever a
              breakpoint is encountered.
			<LI>The <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/40_debugger/10_execution/20_run_without_breakpoints.html">
				<b>Run without breakpoints</b> command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_no_stop_color.gif" width="16" height="16"></a>.
              It has the same behavior except that the execution won't
              stop when a breakpoint is met.
			<LI>The step commands, which execute only a small part of the
              program at a time:
			<UL><LI>The <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/40_debugger/10_execution/40_step_into_a_feature.html">
                    <b>
					step into</b> command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_step_into_color.gif" width="16" height="16"></a>,
					which tries to enter the feature that is about to be called.
                <LI>The <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/40_debugger/10_execution/50_step_by_step.html">
                <b>
                step by step</b> command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_exec_step_color.gif" width="16" height="16"></a>, which
                executes one execution line.
                <LI>The <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/40_debugger/10_execution/60_step_out.html">
                <b>
                step out</b> command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_step_out_color.gif" width="16" height="16"></a>, which
                launches the application and stops it as soon as the application exits the
                feature it is stopped in.
			</UL>
		</UL>

        <P CLASS="tip"><B>Tip</B>: All the above commands can be accessed either in the <b>Project</b> toolbar or in the
        <b>Debug</b> menu.<br>
        They can be used either to launch the program or to resume its execution
        after it has been paused.</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>It is also possible to select <b>Run to breakpoint</b> in a
              <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/40_debugger/20_breakpoints/10_breakpoint_menu.html">breakpoint context menu</a>
              to have the application be launched and
              executed until it reaches the selected execution line.
		</UL>

        <p>Finalized executables can also be run, but they are not debuggable
        and cannot be interrupted. To run a finalized executable, use the
        <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/40_debugger/10_execution/30_run_a_finalized_executable.html"><b>Run
        finalized</b> command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_run_color.gif" width="16" height="16"></a>,
        located in the <b>Project</b> menu and the <b>Project</b>
        toolbar.</p>
