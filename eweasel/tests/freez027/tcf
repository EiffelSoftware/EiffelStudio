test_name 	freeze-with-unused-locals
test_description A recursive routine recurses 15 levels deep and then calls a routine on a Void target.  The exception is supposed to be caught but system dies with a run-time panic if frozen.  If a similar class with all unused local variables removed is frozen, it executes correctly.
