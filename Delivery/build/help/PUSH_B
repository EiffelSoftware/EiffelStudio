WIDGET     : Push button
DESCRIPTION: A push button issues commands within an application. It 
             consists of a text label surrounded by a border shadow. 
             When a push button is selected, the shadow changes to 
             give the appearance that it has been pressed in. When 
             a push button is unselected, the shadow changes to give 
             the appearance that it is out.
