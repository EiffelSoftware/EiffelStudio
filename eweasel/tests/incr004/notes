Class A calls a feature in class B which is exported only to B and its
descendants.  This is valid since class A is a descendant of B.  But
when the inheritance clause is removed, so that A is no longer a
descendant of B, and the system is recompiled, the VUEX violation is
not detected.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
