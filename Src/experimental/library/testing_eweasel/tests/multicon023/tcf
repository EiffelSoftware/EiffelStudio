test_name multi-constraint-renaming2 
test_description After initial compilation VTGC(2) has to occur as `default_create' is renamed twice. The next cycle solves this problem but renamed all `default_create' features of all constraining types to something else. As the creation constraint cites `default_create' a VTGC(3) error should be thrown.
