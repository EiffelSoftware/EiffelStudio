		<paragraph>Adding new expressions to the

				<label>list of expressions</label>

		<paragraph>The first part in the dialog makes it possible to select the context of the expression. The default context is the context of the 
			<link>
				<url>../30_call_stack_tool/20_current_level_information.xml</url>
				<label>currently selected call stack element</label>
			</link>. This context gives access to the locals, the arguments, the result and the enclosing object features. The object context, that requires a valid object address, gives access to the features of the selected object. The last context, the class-related context, gives access to the once and constants features of that class. It requires a valid class name.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The second part prompts for the expression itself. This field supports arguments, dot calls and operators (to a certain extent), but does not support creation expressions, agents or static calls (as in "feature {MY_CLASS}.my_feature"). Genericity is partially supported. Despite these limitations, we believe the expression evaluation tool should provide you with a lot of useful functionality.</paragraph>
