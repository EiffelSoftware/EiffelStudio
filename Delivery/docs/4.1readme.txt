RELEASE NOTES for version 4.1:

- Ace file option to enable multithreading:
  	multithreaded (all | yes | no);
			-- all and yes have the same meaning; default is no.

- Fixed the `hide_implementation' bug: Even if you said `no',
  `hide_implementation' was set to `yes'.

- New environment variable set by the installation procedure:
  COMPILER, denoting the C compiler. Current possible values are msc
  (Microsoft) and bcc (Borland).

- The `PLATFORM' environment variable is automatically set to `windows'
  (for both(  Windows 95 and Windows NT).

- CURRENT USERS: note the change with previous conventions, which used
  different PLATFORM values for each compiler (w32msc and w32bcc).
  The new convention simplifies management and saves space on disk.

- New console: this is now a standard DOS console (with more flexibility
  on NT than on 95).

- The compiler now only generates C-ANSI code.

- You can now use several external editors concurrently. Note, however,
  that external editors will only work for classes whose clusters are
  specified with absolute path names in the Ace file.

- In Workbench mode, the current directory is now the one where the
  workbench program is (for consistency with Unix versions).

- Scrolling bug fixed: when you move the arrow keys past the window
  borders, the text will now scroll automatically.

- Important precompilation note: a precompiled library must be compiled
  in the same mode, multithreaded or not, as the system using it. The
  precompiled libraries currently available for downloading are compiled
  for non-multithreaded, so if you want to use precompiled libraries
  with a multithreaded system you will have to precompile them yourself.
