A generic class whose formal generic parameter is constrained by
NUMERIC has a function `value: G is do Result := x + x end' where `x'
is of type G.  Another class has a call to this function.  If the
system is finalized with inlining, the compiler dies during degree -3
on the class.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
