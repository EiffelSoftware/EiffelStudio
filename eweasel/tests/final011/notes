A particular function `f' with a rescue clause calls another function.
When this called function raises an exception, the rescue clause of
`f' is not executed and there is no retry.  The rescue clause of the
caller of `f' is executed instead.  This incorrect behavior only
occurs if the system is finalized.

Discovered in Release 3.3.4.
