     Local Entity rule

     Let `ld' be the Local_declarations part of a  routine
     `r'   in   a   class   `C'.    Let  `locals'  be  the
     concatenation  of  every  Identifier_list  of   every
     Entity_declaration_group  in `ld'. Then `ld' is valid
     if and only if every Identifier `e' in `ld' satisfies
     the following two conditions:

        1 No feature of `C' has `e' as its final name.

        2 No  formal  argument  of  `r'  has  `e'  as  its
          Identifier.
