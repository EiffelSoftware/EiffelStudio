		<H1>Overview</H1>
		<P>
			EiffelBase, covered by the open-source <A HREF="../../general/licenses/iffel.html">
			IFFEL License</A>, is one of the principal contributions of Eiffel:
			a library of fundamental structures and algorithms covering the basics of computing,
			and resulting from a "Linnaean" effort at a general-purpose taxonomy of computing
			structures.
		</P>

		<H2>Components</H2>
		<UL>
			<LI>The <A HREF="content/kernel.html">Kernel</A> cluster include core classes used in
			all Eiffel systems. These include a universal class providing facilities potentially useful
			for all classes: ANY. Every class is a descendant of this classes. The kernel also defines
			classes needed for exception handling, standard arithmetic operations, hashable elements
			for use with hash tables and basic arithmetic conversions.</LI>
			<LI>The <A HREF="content/structures.html">Data Structure</A> cluster provides
			implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms: Abstract structures,
			describing broad categories; lists in their various forms; list elements; circular chains;
			sorted sets and lists; various trees and binary trees; cursor trees; hash tables
			(dictionaries); various stacks, queues and priority queues; and more.</LI>
			<LI>The <A HREF="content/support.html">Support</A> cluster provides helper classes for
			specific needs. These needs include basic math support, random numbers generation,
			and a few other topics such as the list of ASCII constants.</LI>
			<LI>The <A HREF="content/desc.html">Dynamic External Shared Call (DESC)</A> cluster
			provides mechanisms to call DLL functions at runtime.</LI>
