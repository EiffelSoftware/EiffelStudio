<P>The Feature Menu enables you to find properties of a feature:</P>
<pre>
	(A) Ancestors    : show the ancestor versions of a feature.
	(C) Callers      : show the callers of a feature.
	(D) Descendants  : show the descendant versions of a feature.
	(F) Flat         : show the flat form of a feature.
	(O) Homonyms     : shown the homonyms of a feature.
	(I) Implementers : show the classes implementing a feature.
	(T) Text         : show the text of a feature.
	
	(H) Help         : show list of commands.
	(M) Main         : go back to main menu.
	(Q) Quit         : terminate session.
	(Y) Yank         : yank (save) output of last command to a file.
</pre>

<P>Each command will prompt you for the name of a class and
the name of a feature in that class; you can specify these names (or just the class name) after the command. The Ancestor versions and Descendant versions of a feature are all the versions that appeared in ancestors and descendants. Callers gives you the list of classes which contain calls to the feature; Implementers, the list of classes where the feature is redeclared.
