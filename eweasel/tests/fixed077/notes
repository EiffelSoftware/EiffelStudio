Compiling a system whose Ace specifies creation procedure `make' when
the root class has no creation procedures causes the compiler to
correctly report a validity violation (VD27).  But when the creation
procedure specification is removed from the Ace, the compiler still
reports violation of VD27.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.04.21.
