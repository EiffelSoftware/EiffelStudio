Simple example
==============

This is a very simple system that can be executed as standalone, or hosted as CGI or libFCGI application on Apache, IIS, ...
You will learn how to customize the launcher (port number for standalone, ...), and how to use the interface of `WSF_RESPONSE` to send the response. 
(note: in this example, you have to deal with the Content-Type and Content-Length http header, this requires basic knowledge about the http protocol).
