	%but their types - JVM_CONSTANTS.*_type). Since the stack of the %
   %jvm is not typed, we need to take care of certain things. ie. %
   %when we want to add two numbers we need to know their types and %
   %then issue the correct add instruction (iadd, ladd, fadd or dadd).%
   % to do that we obviously need to know the types of the two top %
   %most stack items. this object helps keeping this information. not %
   %the actual values are stored here (they are unknown most of the %
   %time at compile time anyway) but their jvm types. to simplify %
   %things evert type is only one item, contrary two the jvm stack %
   %model where certain types take two stack words."
