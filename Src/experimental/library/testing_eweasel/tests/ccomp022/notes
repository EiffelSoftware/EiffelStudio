A generic class has a routine with a local whose type is the formal
generic parameter.  Another class inherits from the generic class and
provides an expanded type as actual generic parameter, where the
expanded type's base class has a creation procedure.  If the system is
finalized with dead code removal on, the generated C code will compile
but won't link.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
