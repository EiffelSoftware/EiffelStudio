<h1>The pick-and-drop mechanism</h1>
<p>Pick-and-drop is one of ISE's exclusive technologies and
is provided by HYPERLINK(Vision2 introduction) EiffelVision2. In EiffelStudio it allows you to easily
send data from a component of the interface to another.</p>
<p>You can pick every reference to a <b>development object</b> (like a class, a feature or an execution object)
with a single click on the <b>rightmost</b> mouse button. Then as you start moving the mouse around - not pressing
any of its buttons - a pebble tracks the cursor position, and a line continuously connects the pebble to the
object's original position. The pebble's shape indicates the type of the development object that you picked
(oval disk for a class, cross for a feature, folder for a cluster...).
<p>SCREENSHOT (picking a class in the editor)</p>
<p>You may terminate this situation in either of two ways:
	<ul>
		<li>If the pebble you are dragging is not crossed, you can right-click again to confirm the pick-and-drop
		and so effectively send the dragged development object to the targetted component.
		SCREENSHOT (pebble over a valid target)
		<p>Right-clicking when the pebble is crossed will do nothing because the component you are pointing with the
		mouse does not accept your development object.
		SCREENSHOT (pebble over an invalid target)</p>
		<li>If, for any reason, you change your mind, you can cancel the pick-and-drop by left-clicking anywhere
		or by pressing the Escape key.
	</ul>
