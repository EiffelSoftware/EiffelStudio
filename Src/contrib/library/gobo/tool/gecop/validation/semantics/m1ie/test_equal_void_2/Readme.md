# Semantics M1IE

This [test](.) is exercising the semantics rule [`M1IE`](../Readme.md).

### Description

In this test, we have an inequality expression of the form `c /= d` where `c` is attached to an object of type `STRING` and `d` is Void. The value of this expression is true because `c` and `d` is not both Void.
