test_name 	 strip-bad-linked-list
test_description A class with one attribute, which is of type LINKED_LIST [STRING], repeatedly calls `strip ()' and checks the result.  The system compiles fine, but executing it yields some `strip' result arrays whose first element does not conform to LINKED_LIST [STRING].  Trying to print the offending first element terminates system execution with an illegal instruction.
