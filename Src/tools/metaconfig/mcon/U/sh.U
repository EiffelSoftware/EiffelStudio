?S:sh:
?S:	This variable contains the full pathname of the shell used
?S:	on this system to execute Bourne shell scripts.  Usually, this will be
?S:	/bin/sh, though it's possible that some systems will have /bin/ksh,
?S:	/bin/pdksh, /bin/ash, /bin/bash, or even something such as
?S:	D:/bin/sh.exe.
?S:	This unit comes before Options.U, so you can't set sh with a -D
?S:	option, though you can override this (and startsh)
?S:	with -O -Dsh=/bin/whatever -Dstartsh=whatever
?S:.
?C:SH_PATH:
?C:	This symbol contains the full pathname to the shell used on this

$me:  Fatal Error:  I can't find a Bourne Shell anywhere.  

Usually it's in /bin/sh.  How did you even get this far?
Please contact me (<$maintname>) at <$maintloc> and 
we'll try to straighten this all out.
