		<h1>A Basic EiffelWeb Sample</h1>
		<p>

			This sample shows how to retrieve and display information from a
            basic form on a web page.<p>
		<p CLASS="note">
			<b>Note:</b> This sample requires a web server supporting CGI in
            order to be run. Both the Internet Information Services web server
            from Microsoft and the GNU Apache server may be used.<h2>Compiling</h2>
		<p>
			To compile the example:
		</p>
		<ul>

			<li>Launch EiffelStudio.
			<li>Select <b>Use existing Ace (control file)</b> and click <b>OK</b>.
			<li>Browse to <i>Eiffel52\examples\web\basic\</i>.
			<li>Choose <i>Ace.mswin.ace</i> on Windows platforms or <i>Ace.unix.ace</i> on Unix platforms.
			<li>Choose the directory where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the Ace file.
			<li>Click <b>OK</b>.</ul>

		<p>
		<h2>Installing</h2>
		<p>The workbench version of the example (i.e. the version
        compiled either by melting or freezing) relies on the file <i>
        web_demo.melted</i> to execute properly. However the process is
        launched by the web server which means that this file will not be in the
        <i>path</i> of the application. It is possible to set a registry entry
        that will tell the Eiffel runtime where to find this file. The sample includes the file <i>web.reg</i>

        that you can edit by replacing the line:</p>
		<code>&quot;MELT_PATH&quot;=&quot;c:\\eiffel52\\examples\\web\\basic\\eifgen\\w_code&quot;</code><p>
        with the path to the <i>W_Code</i> folder where you have compiled the
        example (the <i>W_Code</i> folder is located underneath the <i>Eifgen</i>

        folder). Once you have edited the file, simply double click it to
        register the changes in the registry (click <i>Yes </i>when prompted).</p>
		<p>
        You should then copy the file <i>web_demo.exe</i> in the <i>cgi_bin</i>
        directory of your web server and the file <i>sample.html</i> in a
        directory on the web server.</p>

		<h2>
        Running</h2>
		<p>
        To run the example, access the page <i>sample.html</i> that you copied
        on the web server with a web browser (typically <i>
        http://localhost/sample.html</i>). Fill in the text field with a
        username and click <i>Submit</i>. You should see a page displaying the
        name you jsut entered. Although not earth-shattering, this sample shows
        the basis for building more complex forms processing in Eiffel.</p>

		<h2>Under the Hood</h2>
		<p>
		This basic sample has just one class
		<a CLASS="eclass" HREF="root_cluster/sample_chart.html">SAMPLE</a> which inherits from
		<a CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/web/reference/cgi_handling/cgi_interface_chart.html">CGI_INTERFACE</a>.
		<a CLASS="eclass" HREF="root_cluster/sample_chart.html">SAMPLE</a> implements
		<a CLASS="efeature" HREF="root_cluster/sample.html#f_execute">execute</a> which retrieves the
		name entered in the form and creates a new HTML page with it.
		</p>
