test_name 	 freeze-no-c-compile-melt
test_description After initial compilation where the system is frozen, but without C code compilation, an inheritance clause is removed, which removes a class from the system.  Changes are melted.  When system cannot be executed (because C code wasn't compiled), an attempt is made to compile the C code.  However, it won't link due to an undefined symbol.
