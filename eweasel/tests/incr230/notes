A system with a VTCG error caused by type `expanded STRING' as an
actual generic parameter that does not conform to ANY is compiled.
The compiler correctly detects the error.  When the actual generic is
changed to STRING, the compiler still reports a VTCG error though none
is present.

Discovered in Release 5.5.0820.
