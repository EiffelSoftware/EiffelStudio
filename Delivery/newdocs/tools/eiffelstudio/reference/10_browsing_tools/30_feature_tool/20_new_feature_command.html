<h1>New feature command</h1>
<p>The new feature command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_feature_small_color.gif">
located in the <A HREF="00_introduction.html">feature tool</a>
acts like the <A HREF="../../70_wizards_and_dialogs/30_dialogs/10_new_feature_dialog/00_introduction.html">main new feature command</A>.
Clicking it pops up the same dialog, making it possible to add a new feature in
the currently edited class.

<p>This command is only available when the class currently in the editor is
compiled, can be modified, and has a file on the disk (this may not be the case if the class is
precompiled).</p>
