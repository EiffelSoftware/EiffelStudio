A procedure sets an attribute of type REAL to the value passed in as
an argument.  Then the procedure checks whether the attribute is equal
to the value just assigned to it.  If the system is frozen then the
attribute is not equal to the value assigned to it.  Melted code works
correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
