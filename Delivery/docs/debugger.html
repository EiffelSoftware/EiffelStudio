<br>
1  INTRODUCTION<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
   To debug an Eiffel system and, more generally, monitor its execution,<br>
   you will use a combination of:<br>
<br>
	-The Project Tool, to start execution steps.<br>
<br>
	-One or more Feature Tools, to follow execution of instructions.<br>
<br>
	-One or more Object Tools, to inspect the contents of objects at run time.<br>
<br>
<br>
2  ATTACHED TOOLS<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
   Besides ordinary Feature and Object Tools, which you will have to<br>
   retarget explicitly to a certain feature or object, you can use attached<br>
   tools, which will reflect the state of the execution.<br>
<br>
   There are 2 buttons in the middle of the command bar in the Project Tool:&nbsp;<br>
   	-the left one is to display the attached Object Tool.&nbsp;<br>
	-the right one is to display the attached Feature Tool.<br>
<br>
<br>
   When displayed, the Feature Tool will, whenever execution stops,<br>
   show the current execution position, using the Stop Points format.<br>
<br>
<br>
3  AN EXAMPLE DEBUGGING SESSION<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<br>
   To put a stop point on procedure :<br>
<br>
	-make by drag-and-dropping it into the Stop Point hole of the&nbsp;<br>
	 Project Tool. The Project Tool display indicates that a stop&nbsp;<br>
	 point has been added.<br>
	-accelerator:  Ctrl Shift+right-click<br>
<br>
   At each stage, the red arrow -> shows the instruction that will be<br>
   executed next.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
   To terminate execution :<br>
<br>
	-Ctrl-click the Terminate button in the Project Tool (top-right bar).<br>
	-accelerator: Ctrl+E<br>
<br>
<br>
4  STOP POINTS AND STOPPABLE ROUTINES<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<br>
   A routine is stoppable if you have put a stop point on the routine as a<br>
   whole or one of its instructions. Even if you remove the stop point later<br>
   on, the routine remains stoppable.<br>
<br>
   Stoppable routines are important because the Single-Step  and To<br>
   End of Routine  execution formats apply to these routines. For<br>
   example if you resume execution in Single-Step format it will single-step<br>
   through the instructions of the first stoppable routine that it encounters.<br>
<br>
<br>
5  INTERRUPTING AND TERMINATING EXECUTION<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
   You can click the Interrupt button (the little bomb) to interrupt execution&nbsp;<br>
   at the first applicable instruction of the first stoppable routine to be&nbsp;<br>
   encountered.<br>
<br>
   To terminate execution rather than just interrupting it, control-click the<br>
   Interrupt button.<br>
<br>
<br>
6  SETTING AND REMOVING STOP POINTS<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
   You set a stop point by drag-and-dropping an appropriate element to a<br>
   Stop Point hole . The elements that can be drag-and-dropped in this<br>
   manner are:<br>
<br>
	-Entire routines.<br>
<br>
	-Individual instructions of a routine, which you obtain by targeting<br>
	 a Feature Tool to the routine and selecting the Stop Points format.&nbsp;<br>
	 The clickable element in that case is the three consecutive dots ...&nbsp;<br>
	 that appear to the left of the instruction.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
   If a stop point has already been set on instruction, the three dots ... are<br>
   replaced by three vertical bars |||, as illustrated by the last instruction<br>
   above.<br>
<br>
   When you set or remove a stop point, the Project Tool display reflects<br>
   the current Stop Point situation.<br>
<br>
   The Stop Point hole (which you find in both the Project Tool and<br>
   Feature Tools) acts as a toggle: to remove a stop point, drag-and-drop<br>
   it again to the hole. The source of the drag-and-drop can be in a Class<br>
   Tool (for a routine), a stop point marker (... or |||) in a Feature Tool, or<br>
   a stop point indicator appearing in the Project Tool as shown in the last<br>
   figure.<br>
<br>
<br>
7  EXECUTION INFORMATION<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
   When you click the Run button, execution starts or, if previously&nbsp;<br>
   interrupted, restarts. If it proceeds with interruption and terminates,&nbsp;<br>
   the message `System terminated' will appear in the Project Tool. But any&nbsp;<br>
   of the following events may cause execution to stop before termination:<br>
<br>
	-You click Interrupt .<br>
<br>
	-An exception occurs. (In this case the execution will be interrupted<br>
	 just before the exception, so that you can use the environment's<br>
	 mechanisms to browse classes, features and objects. If you click Run<br>
	 once more the exception will be triggered for good.)<br>
<br>
	-Execution reaches a stop point (except in Ignore Stop Points format).<br>
<br>
	-The next instruction is executed (in Step-by-step  format).<br>
<br>
	-The end of the routine is reached (in To End of Routine  format).<br>
<br>
   In any case, the display will show the execution status and the call stack.<br>
<br>
   All the elements shown are clickable. The local entities of all the<br>
   routines on the call stack are accessible; to move up and down the<br>
   stack, use Up and Down buttons.<br>
<br>
<br>
8  LIMITATION IN MULTITHREADED MODE<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
   For now the EIFFEL debugger is not fully multithreaded safe.&nbsp;<br>
   it is possible to put a break-point in any class which doesn't inherit<br>
   from the class THREAD, if it is not called in the execution of a thread.<br>
<br>
