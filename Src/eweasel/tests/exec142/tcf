test_name 	invariant-changes-current
test_description A class creates an instance of a second class and calls a boolean feature `is_value_required' on it.  The second class has an invariant that changes the value of a CHARACTER attribute, which affects the result returned by `is_value_required'.  Code compiles fine when frozen with all assertions turned on, but when the system is executed it dies with a segmentation violation.  Finalized code does not die, but it incorrectly prints "False" instead of "True".
