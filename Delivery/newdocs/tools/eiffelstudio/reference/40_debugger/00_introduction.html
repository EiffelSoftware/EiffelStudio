<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A debugger is a tool that allows you to <a HREF="10_execution/00_introduction.html">run</a> an application and view its state at any
moment. This includes having information concerning the current <a HREF="30_call_stack_tool/00_introduction.html">call stack</a> and
the <a HREF="40_object_tool/00_introduction.html">state of objects</a> of the system, ie the values of
their attributes. This kind of
information can be used to spot objects that have invalid states, to see the
consequences of the execution of a feature over an object state, and so on.
<p>The new features of the EiffelStudio debugger include:
<ul>
  <li>Stopping the application in frozen features as well as in
    melted features
  <li> <a HREF="10_execution/40_step_into_a_feature.html">Stepping into</a> features, <a HREF="10_execution/50_step_by_step.html">executing them one line at a time</a>, or
    <a HREF="10_execution/60_step_out.html">stepping out</a> of them
  <li>Setting <a HREF="20_breakpoints/00_introduction.html">breakpoints</a> on-the-fly, while the execution is running
  <li>A completely new interface, fully graphical and easier to use
</ul>
