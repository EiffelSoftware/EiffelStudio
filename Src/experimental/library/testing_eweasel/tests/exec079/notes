A routine which conditionally raises an exception has a rescue clause
which always retries, but which first calls the routine itself
recursively the first time the rescue clause is executed.  Executing
the system with garbage collection off causes a run-time panic if the
number of retries is moderately large (331 or greater).

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
