<h1>Porting EiffelBase to .NET</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>To make things simple, we will reference as EiffelBase the version of 
EiffelBase that does not run on .NET, and we will reference as EiffelBase.NET 
the version of EiffelBase that targets .NET.</p>

<h2>ANY</h2>

<p>Porting the features of EiffelBase to EiffelBase.NET starts by making sure 
that ANY from EiffelBase.NET contains all the features of ANY from EiffelBase. 
Doing so introduces a lot of name conflicts since .NET is using names such as 
clone, copy, equal, is_equal, default....</p>

<h2>Basic types</h2>

<p>After updating ANY, all basic types have to be updated so that they inherit 
from the _REF counterpart. This means that _REF corresponds to the boxed version 
of the basic types. If the language change to introduce `reference' was done, we 
would not have to do so, but unfortunately the specification is not done.</p>

<h3>Characters</h3>

<p>A quite big issue in porting EiffelBase to .NET is the recent introduction in 
normal Eiffel of the new basic type WIDE_CHARACTER. The issue is that .NET only 
supports wide character, it does not have an abstract data type for ASCII 
character. Since the addition is quite recent, we decided not to include 
WIDE_CHARACTER and its WIDE_CHARACTER_REF counterpart in the kernel cluster of 
EiffelBase.NET.</p>

<h3>BITs</h3>

<p>Even though the class BIT_REF has been included in EiffelBase.NET, it does 
not have any special code handling from the compiler.</p>
