WEL Tutorial
------------

This directory contains the Eiffel projects corresponding
to each steps in the tutorial.

Directory `step1': Creating an application
Directory `step2': Defining a main window class
Directory `step3': Drawing text in a window
Directory `step4': Drawing lines in a window
Directory `step5': Changing line thickness
Directory `step6': Repainting a window
Directory `step7': Adding a menu
Directory `step8': Storing the drawing in a file

Starting with step5, a ressource file may be required. To be able
to use a ressource, Eiffelbench needs a C compiler. For people who
do not have a C compiler, we provide a different methode (methode 2)
to avoid using ressource files. If you are in this case, please
always use the second methode.
