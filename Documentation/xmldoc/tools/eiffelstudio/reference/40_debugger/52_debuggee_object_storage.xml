		<tip>By Pick-and-Dropping an object onto the button, you can load the retrieved values into the dropped object (make sure it has same type).</tip>
		<warning>For now this command is pretty basic, and provided as it is. The underlying implementation is using <code>{FILE}.independent_store and {FILE}.retrieved</code> for save and load operation, to load the value into an existing object, it is using <code>{ANY}.standard_copy (..)</code>. For details, you can have a look at the RT_EXTENSION_GENERAL code </warning>
