test_name 	 lace-debug-key-subset
test_description An option clause in an Ace file specifies that one debug key is to be enabled for classes A and B and a second debug key is to be enabled only for class A.  When the system is executed, the second debug key is monitored for both classes A and B.  Reversing the order of the debug clauses corrects the problem.
