A procedure which prints out some real and double constants executes
correctly after first compile and freezing.  When it is modified
(presumably causing melting) and re-executed, incorrect values are
printed for the numbers.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
Prerelease 93.04.21: all of the values are OK except one.
Fixed in Prerelease 93.07.15.
