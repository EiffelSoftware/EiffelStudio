A class A repeatedly calls a procedure on an instance of another class
B.  Class B has a class invariant with a call to a function of class
B, which in turn calls a function on an attribute of type C.  The
system compiles fine, but when executed it quickly runs out of memory
if the system was melted and if `assertion (invariant)' is specified
in the Ace.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
