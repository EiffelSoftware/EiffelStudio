Object Oriented Model To Relational Model (OOM2RM)

This example illustrates how to dynamically generate
the description of a relational schema (with SQL statements) 
from the traversal of a network of Eiffel objects.

One Eiffel model sample is given in subdirectory Model1
and serves as the sample to use to generate the relational schema.

To apply the example on a model of your choice, replace
in the Ace file reference to the cluster Model1 with a reference
to your customized cluster.



CAVEAT
Some problems have been encountered when using generic containers classes
derived with simple type.
To overcome this problem, rather use ARRAY [INTEGER_REF] instead of 
ARRAY [INTEGER].
