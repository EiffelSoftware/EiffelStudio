EiffelStudio is a modern IDE offering the following features:

* Complete compiler for the Eiffel programming language, with both high compile-time speed and high-performance executables
* Support for Windows, MacOS X, Linux, *BSD, Solaris and other operating systems
* Smart code editor
* Sophisticated multi-view browsing and viewing facilities
* Interactive debugger
* Graphical modelling tool for UML and BON with full roundtrip
* Refactoring support
* GUI development tool and fully portable GUI library

The Eiffel compiler creates C code that is then handed to a standard C compiler. As a result, Eiffel programs have a run-time performance comparable to those directly written in C or C++. At the same time, Eiffel is an object-oriented and strongly typed language. EiffelStudio uses a highly efficient compacting garbage collector to free the developer from the burden of memory management.
