		<H1>What's new in EiffelStudio 5.4</H1>
		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
		<h3>Improvements</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>Added support for mouse wheel in editor and associated 
          parameterization in preferences.</li>
          <li>Cluster tree is not collapsed anymore between compilation.</li>
          <li>All callers will not show empty entries.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>Fixed issue where setting the string background color to `auto' in 
          the preferences will set it to a black color next time your relaunch 
          EiffelStudio.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue where typing in an empty features tree will close down 
          EiffelStudio.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue with BON diagram where expanded client links were not 
          properly displayed (the expanded bar was drawn on top of classes 
          instead of on the link itself).</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Compiler</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click
          <a href="../30_compiler/60_version_history/04_54_release/00_53_to_54_changes.html">here</a> 
          for the compiler release notes.</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Libraries</h2>
        <h3>Eiffel2Java</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed incorrect memory freeing in <span class="efeature">get_string</span> in <span class="eclass">JNI_ENVIRONMENT</span> 
          that could cause some memory corruption.</li>
          <li>Fixed <span class="eerror">VDRD</span> error in <span class="efeature">method_id</span> from <span class="eclass">JAVA_OBJECT</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelBase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimized <span class="efeature">i_th</span> from <span class="eclass">PRIMES</span> for 
          the first 200 prime numbers.</li>
          <li>Fixed bug in <span class="efeature">generic_typecode</span> from <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span> in .NET implementation 
          which fixed an issue with <span class="efeature">is_reference_item</span>.</li>
          <li>Made <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span> a descendant of <span class="eclass">HASHABLE</span> 
          and defined <span class="efeature">hash_code</span> (based on the hash_codes of the 
          elements of a <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span>).</li>
          <li>Added <span class="efeature">default_create</span> as creation procedure of <span class="eclass">
          TUPLE</span> and made <span class="efeature">make</span>
          obsolete.</li>
          <li>Added convenience features to <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span>: <span class="efeature">put_XX_item</span> where `XX' can be 
          replaced by `character, boolean, integer, double,...'.</li>
          <li>Optimized <span class="eclass">ROUTINE</span>, <span class="eclass">PROCEDURE</span> and <span class="eclass">FUNCTION</span> 
          implementation to speed up agent calls by a factor of 2 to 3. Removed 
          <span class="efeature">open_operand_type</span> from <span class="eclass">ROUTINE</span> as its specification was only used 
          internally and specification was not precise enough to be used by 
          clients of <span class="eclass">ROUTINE</span>.</li>
          <li>Fixed <span class="efeature">set_directory</span> from <span class="eclass">PATH_NAME</span> on Windows so that it will append a `\' if 
          needed before appending the directory name.</li>
          <li>Fixed <span class="efeature">append</span> from <span class="eclass">SEQUENCE</span> to not perform a
          <span class="efeature">deep_clone</span> when passed 
          argument is the same reference as Current. This was a problem when the 
          base class of the type of the elements inherited from <span class="eclass">MEMORY</span> and 
          redefined <span class="efeature">dispose</span>. You could possibly end up freeing twice an external 
          resource.</li>
          <li>Changed implementation of <span class="eclass">INTERACTIVE_LIST</span> to be based on 
          <span class="eclass">ARRAYED_LIST</span> rather than on <span class="eclass">LINKED_LIST</span>.</li>
          <li>Added efficient implementation of <span class="efeature">append</span> in <span class="eclass">ARRAYED_LIST</span>.</li>
          <li>Fixed bug in multithreaded mode when you open in two different 
          threads a different file with a different mode. For example one is in 
          read mode, the other one is in write mode. If the operation happens at 
          the same time, you could end up with two files open in read mode or 
          two files open in write mode, which is not the expected behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelNet</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bug in <span class="efeature">set_delay</span> and <span class="efeature">set_nodelay</span>
           in <span class="eclass">NETWORK_STREAM_SOCKET</span>, because their implementations were inverted.</li>
          <li>Fixed incorrect spelling of <span class="efeature">
          maximum_seg_size</span> in <span class="eclass">NETWORK_STREAM_SOCKET</span>.</li>
          <li>Added recoverable storable to EiffelNet (was not included in 
          previous version although recoverable storable was available for 
          files).</li>
          <li>Fixed <span class="eclass">SMTP_PROTOCOL</span> to follow more closely SMTP RFCs.</li>
          <li>Added support for multi-line error codes in <span class="eclass">SMTP_PROTOCOL</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelTime</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved speed of <span class="eclass">DATE</span> and <span class="eclass">TIME</span> comparison.</li>
          <li>In <span class="eclass">DATE_VALUE</span> added 
          <span class="efeature">ordered_compact_date</span> and made <span class="efeature">compact_date</span> 
          obsolete.</li>
          <li>In <span class="eclass">DATE </span>added <span class="efeature">make_by_ordered_compact_date</span> and 
          made
          <span class="efeature">make_by_compact_date</span> obsolete.</li>
          <li>In <span class="eclass">DATE_VALIDITY_CHECKER</span> added <span class="efeature">ordered_compact_date_valid</span>.</li>
          <li>Fixed <span class="eclass">C_DATE</span> to bufferize the current time rather than querying it 
          for each of the time components. Not doing that was causing a bug in 
          <span class="eclass">DATE</span>, <span class="eclass">DATE_TIME</span> and <span class="eclass">TIME</span> where if the computation was done on December 
          31st at 23:59:59 2003, we could end up with a date of January 1st 
          2003, therefore being one year off. This is a breaking change from 
          before and  if you are using C_DATE, use <span class="efeature">update</span> 
          before each call to the <span class="efeature">*_now</span> queries if 
          you expected to reflect the time at the time of the query.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelThread</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Added support for .NET</li>
          <li>Made <span class="eclass">OBJECT_OWNER</span> obsolete</li>
          <li>Added <span class="efeature">wait_with_timeout</span> in <span class="eclass">CONDITION_VARIABLE</span></li>
          <li>Added <span class="eclass">READ_WRITE_LOCK</span> class to be used 
          in a system where few writes are done compare to reads. A typical 
          example of its use would be to have a thread safe lookup table where 
          few insertions are done.</li>
          <li>Now a C externals that might block the execution of a system, 
          should be marked `blocking'.

        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelVision2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>

        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelWeb</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed issue when sending exception trace to browser. On most 
          servers you were getting an internal error rather than the exception 
          trace.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue with <span class="efeature">cookies</span> from <span class="eclass">CGI_ENVIRONMENT</span> as keys were stored 
          as items, now the keys are stored as keys, items as items.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>WEL</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Renamed <span class="efeature">convert</span> from <span class="eclass">CONVERTER</span> class into
           <span class="efeature">extract_definition</span>.</li>
          <li>Renamed <span class="efeature">convert</span> from 
          <span class="eclass">WEL_FONT_FAMILY_ENUMERATOR</span> class into <span class="efeature">update_current</span>.</li>
			<li>In <span class="eclass">WEL_TREE_VIEW</span>, calling <span class="efeature">deselect_item</span> will now really deselect the item, whereas previously, it only caused the item to be redrawn without selection.</li>
			<li>In <span class="eclass">WEL_REGISTRY</span>, <span class="efeature">open_value_key</span> will now accept an empty 
            string so that the default key value can be read.</li>
			<li>Fixed issue with <span class="efeature">dword_value</span> in <span class="eclass">WEL_REGISTRY_KEY_VALUE</span> 
            which returned incorrect values.</li>
			<li>Made <span class="efeature">make</span> in <span class="eclass">WEL_REGISTRY_KEY_VALUE</span> accepts 
            only string values, if you want to create a new instance with a 
            value of a different type you need to use the new creation 
            procedure <span class="efeature">make_with_value</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>.NET libraries</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Renamed <span class="eclass">THREAD</span> and <span class="eclass">MUTEX</span> into <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_THREAD</span> and <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_MUTEX</span> to 
          avoid name conflicts with EiffelThread.</li>
        </ul>
