SSL support with Standalone connector
=====================================

Almost the same as `simple` example, except this `simple_ssl` example is using only the `standalone` connector, and is supporting `https://` request. You will learn how to configure the .ecf file to add ssl support (see `<variable name="ssl_enabled" value="true"/>`), and how to enable it for instance via the `simple.ini` file (imported from the class `APPLICATION`).
