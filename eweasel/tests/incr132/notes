An external routine which does not take any arguments is declared as a
macro and includes the signature `(EIF_INTEGER)'.  The compiler
detects an error during degree 3, but prints "exception occurred while
displaying error message".  Repeatedly resuming the compilation causes
compiler termination after about 40 attempts.

Discovered in Release 3.3 beta.
