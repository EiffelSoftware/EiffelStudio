A pair of generic classes that mention each other in their formal
generic constraints is invalid.  When some of the actual generic
parameters are NONE, the compiler correctly detects the VTCG error.
But when compilation is resumed without any change to the classes, the
compiler dies with a bus error.

Discovered in Release 5.0.015.
