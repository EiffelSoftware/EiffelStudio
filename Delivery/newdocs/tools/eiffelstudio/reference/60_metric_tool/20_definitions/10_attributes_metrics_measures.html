		<H1>Attributes, metrics and measures</H1>
        <P>The most general notion is
        “attribute”: </P>

		<P CLASS="note"><B>Attribute</B>: An <b>attribute </b>is a
        property, qualitative or quantitative, of software products or
        processes.</P>

        <p>We may
        distinguish between the product and process cases:&nbsp;</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b>Product
        attribute, process attribute</b>: A
        <b>product attribute </b>is an attribute that characterizes a software
        product or set of products. A <b>process attribute </b>is an attribute
        that characterizes a software-related process, such as development,
        maintenance, documentation, management, or multiple instances of such a
        process.</P>
        <p>Examples of
        attributes include reliability (a product attribute, non-quantitative)
        and total project cost (process, quantitative).</p>

        <p>A metric is
        simply a quantitative attribute:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b><a name="Metric">Metric</a></b>:
        A <b>metric </b>is an
        attribute whose values are numbers (integers or reals), expressed
        relative to a certain <b>unit </b>specified as part of the metric’s
        definition.</P>
        <p>Examples of
        metrics include the number of source lines of a program (product) and
        the total cost of a project (process).</p>

        <p>The metric tool provides by default a set of metrics, they are
        available in the following metric menu:</p>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelbench/Metrics_png/metricmenu.png"></p>

        <p >Attributes other
        than metrics will be called “qualitative”:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b>Qualitative
        attribute</b>: A <b>qualitative
        attribute </b>is an attribute other than a metric.</P>
        <p >An example of
        qualitative attribute is the reliability of a software product.</p>
        <p>The
        “process” vs. “product” distinction carries over to metrics:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b>Product
        metric, process metric</b>: A
        metric is a <b>product metric </b>if it is a product attribute, a <b>process
        metric </b>if it is a process attribute.</P>
        <p>“Relevance”, as defined in the previous section, suggest that
        the purpose of metrics is to help us gain information about attributes
        that are of direct interest to us. Often these will be qualitative; for
        example we may want to estimate the reliability of our software. Metrics
        provide us with numerical values that can serve to assess or predict
        such attributes.</p>
        <p>Applying a
        metric will give us measures:</p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b><a name="Measure">Measure</a>
        </b>:A <b>measure </b>is the value of a metric for a certain process or
        product.</P>
