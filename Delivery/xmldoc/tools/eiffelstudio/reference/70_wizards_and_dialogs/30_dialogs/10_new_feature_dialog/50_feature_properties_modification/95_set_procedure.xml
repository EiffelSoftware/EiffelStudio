		<paragraph>When creating an attribute, it is common that you will also need a set-procedure for it. For example, for attribute 
			<code>
				<feature_name>property</feature_name>
			</code> you need a procedure 
			<code>
				<feature_name>set_property</feature_name>
			</code> to set it. This feature takes one argument of the same type as 
			<code>
				<feature_name>property</feature_name>
			</code> or is anchored to it. The only thing you have to do with the feature wizard is check the button 
			<bold>Generate set procedure</bold>.

		<paragraph>The feature that is generated in addition to the attribute itself is placed in feature clause 
			<code>
				<comment>Element change</comment>
			</code> and is exported to all classes. If you have selected or entered an invariant, the precondition will protect this invariant. Example of a generated set-procedure:

			</image>
		</div>
		<code_block>
feature -- Element change

	set_button (a_button: EV_BUTTON) is
			-- Assign `a_button' to `button'
		require
			a_button_not_void: a_button /= Void
		do
			button := a_button
		ensure
			button_assigned: button = a_button
		end
