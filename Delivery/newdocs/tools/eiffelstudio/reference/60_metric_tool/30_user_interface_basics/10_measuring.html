        <h1>Measuring</h1>
        <p>Now
        that we have defined all basic notions such as metrics. metric hierarchy
        and scopes, let us see how the metric tool can help in evaluating a
        project.</span></p>
        <p>Many
        commands are provided in the tool to compute measures and handle them.
        Indeed, it is possible to calculate metrics, save measures in order to
        retrieve them later on, request details for a given measure when
        available and eventually delete a set of measures.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/metrics_png/measure_facilities.png"></p>
        <p>To
        perform a measure, you simply choose a metric and a scope, and
        request the computation, by clicking the &quot;calculate&quot; button.<o:p></o:p>
        This operation allows to evaluate the selected metric over the selected
        scope. The measure is displayed in the provided text field, but it is not
        saved
        yet.</p>
        <p>To
        multi-column list displays the recorded measures. To save a measure,
        click on the &quot;Add &amp; save&quot; button. The last calculated
        measure appears in the multi-column list and is saved in a
        file automatically generated by the interface. The file is located in the Metric
        subfolder of the current project location.</p>
        <p>For
        &quot;big&quot; scopes (in the sense of the total ordering previously
        defined) details are sometimes
        available concerning the evaluated metric, and then the
        &quot;detail&quot; button is sensitive. It displays measures resulting
        from applying the requested metric over all smaller scopes.</p>
        <p>It
        is possible to remove some measures after having saved them thanks to
        the &quot;delete&quot; button. Measures will be removed both from the
        multi-column list and from the file they were saved in.</p>
        <p>After having recompiled a project, the recorded measures may no
        longer be accurate. The icon <img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_red_cross.gif">
        replaces <img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_green_tick.gif">
        to inform users that measures have been calculated before the last
        recompilation, and therefore may be obsolete.
        Updating measures is possible by right clicking on the multi-column list
        and choosing an item from the context menu. Measures will be updated both
        in the multi-column list and in the file they were saved in.</p>
