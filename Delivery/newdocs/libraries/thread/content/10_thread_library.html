<H1>Thread library overview</H1>
<p>This is only a quick overview of the <A HREF="/libraries/thread/reference/introduction.html">Thread library</a>. The reference of this
library should give all its content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Creating and launching threads: the class THREAD (deferred)</h2>
<p>The class of the thread object you want to create should inherit the THREAD class.<br>
Your thread is represented by a class which inherits from THREAD (deferred
class).
<pre>	class
		MY_THREAD

	inherit
		THREAD
		...

	feature

		execute is
			-- define the deferred feature from THREAD.
		do
			...
		end
		...

	end --class MY_THREAD

</pre>
Creating a thread is like creating an Eiffel object:
<pre>	my_thread: MY_THREAD
		-- MY_THREAD inherits from THREAD and defines
		-- the deferred procedure `execute'

	create my_thread</pre>
<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: You have created a thread object but not yet launched it.<br>
To run the thread, use the feature `launch' from THREAD.</P>
<pre>	my_thread.launch</pre>
On the Eiffel side, the procedure `execute' will be launched. This procedure
is deferred in class THREAD, you have to define it in MY_THREAD.&nbsp;
<p>On the C side, a C thread will be created and launched.<p>IMPORTANT: you may call `join_all' and the end of the exceution of the
parent thread if you do not want it to die before its child, otherwise
they may prematurily terminate.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The class MUTEX</h2>
<p>The implementation of the class MUTEX is mapped on the C standard thread
library. An instance of class MUTEX can be shared between different thread
without putting it into a PROXY object.
<p>my_mutex.pointer is the pointer to the nested C mutex of my_mutex.
<p>Declaration of the mutex :
<pre>	my_mutex: MUTEX</pre>
Creation of mutex :
<pre>	create my_mutex.make</pre>
Locking&nbsp; the mutex :&nbsp;
<pre>	my_mutex.lock</pre>
Unlocking the mutex :
<pre>	my_mutex.unlock</pre>
try_lock: if it is not locked yet, lock the mutex and return True, otherwise
it returns False.
<pre>	my_mutex.try_lock</pre>
Is my mutex initialized?
<pre>	my_mutex.is_set</pre>
NOTE: on Windows:
<p>The MUTEX objects on Windows are recursive while they are not on Unix. A
recursive mutex can be locked twice by the same thread.&nbsp;
<p>IMPORTANT: be sure that a mutex is unlocked when it is disposed.
<p>&nbsp;
<h2>The class SEMAPHORE</h2>
<p>Like MUTEX, the features of this class are mapped on the C thread library. An
instance of class SEMAPHORE can be shared between thread without putting into a
PROXY object.
<p>Declaration of the semaphore :
<pre>	my_sem: SEMAPHORE</pre>
Creation of semaphore: initialize semaphore with nb_tokens, it requires
nb_tokens &gt;= 0
<pre>	create my_sem.make (nb_tokens)</pre>
<p>Wait for a token:
<pre>	my_sem.wait</pre>
Give back a token:
<pre>	my_sem.post</pre>
try_wait, similar to try_lock from MUTEX, if a token is available, take
it and return True, otherwise return False.
<pre>	my_sem.try_wait</pre>
<p>IMPORTANT: be sure that a semaphore does not wait for a token when it is
disposed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The class CONDITION_VARIABLE</h2>
<p>This class allows to use condition variables in Eiffel. An instance of class
CONDITION_VARIABLE can be shared between threads without putting into a PROXY
object.<br>
<br>
Declaration of the condition variable
<pre>	my_cond: CONDITION_VARIABLE</pre>
Creation:
<pre>	create my_cond.make</pre>
Wait for a signal (send by `signal'). You need to use a mutex.
<pre>	my_mutex: MUTEX

	create my_mutex.make</pre>
<p>`my_mutex' must be locked by the calling thread so as `wait' can be called.
`wait' atomically unlocks `my_mutex' and waits for the condition variable
`my_cond' to receive a signal. As soon as it received a signal, `my_cond' locks
`my_mutex;
<pre>	my_mutex.lock
		-- You must lock `my_mutex' before calling `wait'.

	my_cond.wait (my_mutex)
		-- Here the critical code to execute when `my_cond' received a signal.

	my_mutex.unlock
		-- Unlock the mutex at the end of the critical section.

	</pre>
Send a signal one thread blocked on the condition variable `my_cond'.
<pre>	my_cond.signal</pre>
Send a signal to all the threads blocked on the condition variable `my_cond'.
<pre>	my_cond.broadcast</pre>
<p>IMPORTANT: be sure that a condition variable is unblocked when it is
disposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous classes</h2>
<p>class THREAD_ATTRIBUTES: defines the
attributes of an Eiffel Thread regarding the thread scheduling policy and
priority.<br>
<h2>Controlling execution: THREAD_CONTROL</h2>
<p>yield: the calling thread yields its execution in favor of&nbsp;an other
thread of same priority.
<p>join_all: the calling thread waits for all other threads to finished (all
its children).
<p>-&gt; A parent thread can wait for the termination of a child process through
the feature `join' of class THREAD_CONTROL (inherited by THREAD):<br>
<pre>	thr: MY_THREAD
	...
	thr.launch
	...
	thr.join</pre>
