A creation instruction is applied to an entity (local or attribute)
which is already attached to an object and the current value of the
entity is passed to the creation procedure (e.g., !!x.make (x)).  If
the code is melted, the newly created object is passed to the creation
procedure instead of the object to which the entity is attached before
the creation instruction.  Frozen code works correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
