A system with a VDRD violation is compiled and the compiler detects
the violation.  Then the offending external routine is deleted and a
routine with the same name but a `do' body is added to the inheriting
class.  When compilation is resumed, the compiler dies with an
exception trace while freezing the system.

Discovered in Release 3.1.1.
