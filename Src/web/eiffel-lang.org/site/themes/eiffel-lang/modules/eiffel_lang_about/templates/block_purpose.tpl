<h1>Purpose</h1>

<p>The Eiffel Programming Language is a forum that bring together the thousands of Eiffel developers around the
world to build libraries, share experiences, and help each other on all matters related to open-source Eiffel.</p>

<p>The siteâ€™s mission is to provide all programmers convinced that Eiffel makes the programming world a better
place with the necessary resources for the betterment of its cause.</p>

<p>The Eiffel Programming Language site is independent from any organization, commercial entity, or single

a handful of volunteers from the community (known as the review board) serve to administer and manage
content throughout the site when necessary.</p>
