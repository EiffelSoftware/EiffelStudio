Version 1.4 - 14 April 1999

	* Multiple types for semantic values now supported
	  in geyacc.
	* In geyacc, $$ entities are now initialized to their
	  default Eiffel values at the beginning of semantic
	  actions and the default for missing actions is "{}"
	  (it used to be "{$$ := $1}" as in yacc and Bison).
	* Added warning/error in geyacc when $N in a semantic
	  action does not match with a symbol in the rule.
	* Fixed bug in output of geyacc verbose mode (option -v).
	* Routine `clear_all' from YY_PARSER_SKELETON clears
	  internal stacks by default (call to `clear_stacks').
	* Added two new types in $GOBO\library\kernel:
	  STRING_BUFFER and FIXED_ARRAY (array with lower
	  bound equal to zero). These two types are used
	  instead of STRING and ARRAY in gelex and geyacc
	  skeleton classes for optimization purposes.
	  STRING_BUFFER maps either to SPECIAL [CHARACTER]
	  or STRING, and FIXED_ARRAY [G] maps either to
	  SPECIAL [G] or ARRAY [G] depending on the Eiffel
	  compiler used. Only ISE Eiffel port has been
	  optimized so far. SmallEiffel port can be optimized
	  as well using FAST_ARRAY [G] or NATIVE_ARRAY [G].
	* Added features `Empty_buffer', `append_text_to_string'
	  and `append_text_substring_to_string' to YY_SCANNER.
	* Added a precondition to routine `set_start_condition'
	  in class YY_SCANNER.
	* Resize input buffer if a call to `unread_character'
	  results in too much text being pushed back (it was
	  raising an run-time error in previous releases).
	* Added command-line option -x to gelex and geyacc
	  to allow the generation of semantic actions in
	  separate routines.
	* Added command-line option -z to gelex to force the
	  generated code to use an "inspect" instruction to
	  find out which action to execute. The default is to
	  use binary-search implemented with "if" instructions.
	* Fixed operator precedence bug in "$GOBO\example\
	  parse\eiffel\eiffel_parser.y".

Version 1.3 - 15 August 1998

	* Geyacc has been totally rewritten in Eiffel.
	* Replaced attribute `output_file' by procedure
	  `output' in class YY_SCANNER to avoid unnecessary
	  console creation in Windows mode with Visual Eiffel.
	* Fixed bug in gelex in "equivalence class" mode when
	  dealing with regular expressions of the form x{4}.
	* Added warnings in gelex when a rule cannot be
	  matched and when the default rule can be matched
	  despite the %option nodefault or -s option.
	* Renamed classes KL_SHARED_*_ROUTINES as 
	  KL_IMPORTED_*_ROUTINES. (The old class names are
	  still temporarily valid using the classes in cluster
	  "$GOBO\library\kernel\obsolete".)
	* Gepp now supports #include "filename" instructions.
	* The second generic parameter of DS_HASH_TABLE is now
	  constrained to HASHABLE (HASHABLE was not part of 
	  SmallEiffel in previous releases).
	* Cluster `error' has been added to the Gobo Eiffel
	  Utility Library to support a flexible error
	  reporting mechanism.

Version 1.2 - 17 December 1997

	* New implementation for variable trailing context
	  in gelex, with warnings for dangerous trailing
	  contexts of form such as x*/xz*.
	* Improved documentation.

Version 1.1 - 29 October 1997

	* Bug fixed wrt variable trailing context in gelex.

Version 1.0 - 14 October 1997

	* First public release.
	* Gold Award at the Eiffel Class Struggle '97.
