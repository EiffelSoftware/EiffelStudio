A routine with a secret precondition does not violate VAPE because the
routine itself is also exported to {NONE}.  But the class containing
this routine is inherited by another class and the routine export
status is changed to {ANY}, yielding a generally available routine
with a secret precondition.  The compiler does not detect the VAPE error.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
