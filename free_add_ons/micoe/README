This project was started in February 1998 by Robert Switzer, who wanted a
complete CORBA implementation in Eiffel that he could use in his courses
and software labs. He began by searching the internet for OSS implementations
in other languages and hit upon the full implementation MICO created (in C++)
by Arno Puder and Kay Roemer at the University of Frankfurt. He was so
impressed by MICO that he decided to take it as a model for his own project.
For MICO there is an impressive theoretical foundation provided by the Diploma Thesis of Kay Roemer. 

By now the mico/E-Team has grown to include 

Robert Switzer
Andreas Scholz
Christian Schroeder 
Martin Armbrecht

We think of the 'E' in mico/E as standing for both "Eiffel" and "Education".
This package should be useful for instruction on CORBA in departments that
teach the language Eiffel. Nevertheless it is our hope that with the
assistance of other members who may join our team it will be possible to
keep mico/E compliant with the latest version of CORBA. 

The newest version of mico/E and the newest information about mico/E are
available on http://www.math.uni-goettingen.de/micoe.

Please send email about any questions/bug fixes/contributions etc. about
mico/E to micoe@math.uni-goettingen.de.
