<h1>Choosing classes to be ignored in BON diagrams</h1>
Every class in your system inherits from ANY. INTEGER, like other classes
that represent basic types, is very often a supplier of the classes the
user wrote. It may therefore not be interesting to display classes such
as ANY or INTEGER in <a href="../../reference/50_diagram_tool/00_introduction.html">BON
diagrams</a>.
<p>EiffelStudio allows you to customize a list of classes that it has to
ignore when it creates diagrams. This list is stored in the <a href="../../reference/85_preferences/00_introduction.html">preferences</a>.
To modify it, first open the <a href="../../reference/85_preferences/10_overview.html">preferences
window</a> by choosing <b>Preferences...</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
Select then the "context tool" sub-category of the "Tools" category in
the preferences tree. On the right, you will then see a table of preferences,
which includes "Show ALL classes in the diagram" and "Names of classes
that should not appear in generated diagrams". If "Show ALL classes in
the diagram" is not False, click on it and set it to False. Then click
on "Names of classes that should not appear in generated diagrams" and
edit the list. Class names must be separated by semicolons.
<p>After modifying the list, click on <b>save and exit</b> to complete
the change.
