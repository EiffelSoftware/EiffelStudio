test_name 	 reduce-bit-attribute-size
test_description A class has an attribute of type `BIT Weasel_bits', where `Weasel_bits' is a very large constant integer.  After initial compilation where the system is melted, the integer value is changed to a very small number.  But system execution still ends with an "unknown attribute type" panic.
