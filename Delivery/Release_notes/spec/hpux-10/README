RELEASE NOTES FOR HPUX 10 VERSION.
----------------------------------

This release has been compiled on HPUX10.20 with cc.

Please your PLATFORM environment variable to hpux-10 if you
are running on hpux 10.x. 


The graphical interface is not working due to a problem with Motif_R6 1.2. 
This version does not support multithreading since the C thread library is
not standard on 10.20. Only 10.30 supports POSIX threads.
