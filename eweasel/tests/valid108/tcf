test_name 	 explicit-creation-bad-generic
test_description A routine has explicit creation instruction with an invalid actual generic parameter.  The creation procedure of the generic class takes an argument of type `G' where `G' is the name of the formal generic parameter.  The compiler should report a VTCG error, but it does not. Compilation ends prematurely with a segmentation fault.
