This directory contains a rudimentary kit maker.

N.B.: This must not be confused with the kit package, which is a set of shell
scripts for sending arbitrary files and directories by mail and unpacking them.
One could call kit a binary tarmailer. The kit package has been released
separately from dist (posted on comp.sources.unix in 1991).

	Depending on where you are going to send your kits you might prefer
	to use Rich $alz's kit maker instead--it makes more robust kits
	but assumes more about the target system.

I say:

	If you are using RCS 4.3, be sure to use makedist instead of your
	own shell archiver, unless you do not use $Id, $Header or $Locker
	markers. Moreover, makedist will take the latest checked in
	revision intead of the working file, so that you archive a coherent
	package even if you made some mods since the last patch.

You run makedist in the top level directory of your package and it uses
the MANIFEST.new file to generate shar scripts of about 50000 bytes each.

Just make sure MANIFEST.new contains everything you want, including any
Configure, config.h.SH, or patchlevel.h files. A prototype patchlevel.h
may be found in ../gen/patchlevel.h. See the manpage for more details.

If you do not wish to build up shell archives but an up-to-date copy of
your source tree, run someting like:

	makedist -c dir

to build an up-to-date source tree in dir, which you can then archive using
your own shell archiver.
