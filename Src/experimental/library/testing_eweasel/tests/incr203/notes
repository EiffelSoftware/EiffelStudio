A system whose Ace specifies `syntax_warning (yes)' is compiled and
the compiler issues warning about obsolete syntax.  Then this clause
is removed from the Ace file and a new use of obsolete syntax is
added.  The compiler warns about the new use of obsolete syntax, but
it should not.

Discovered in Release 5.4.0403.
