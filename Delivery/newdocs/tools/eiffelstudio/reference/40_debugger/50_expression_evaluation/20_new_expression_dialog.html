<h1>New expression dialog</h1>
<p>Adding new expressions to the <A HREF="10_expression_list.html">list of expressions</a> that should be dynamically
evaluated is performed via a dialog.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../../../../images/eiffelstudio/dialogs_and_wizards/new_expression_definition_dlg.png"></p>
<p align="left">The first part in the dialog makes it possible to select the
context of the expression. The default context is the context of the 
<a href="../30_call_stack_tool/20_current_level_information.html">currently
selected call stack element</a>. This context gives access to the locals, the
arguments, the result and the englobing object features. The object context,
that requires a valid object address, gives access to the features of the
selected object. The last context, the class-related context, gives access to
the once and constants features of that class. It requires a valid class name.<p align="left">The
second part prompts for the expression itself. This field supports arguments,
dot calls and operators (to a certain extent), but does not support creation
expressions, agents or static calls (as in &quot;feature {MY_CLASS}.my_feature&quot;).
Genericity is partially supported. Despite these limitations, we believe the
expression evaluation tool should provide you with a lot of useful
functionality.
