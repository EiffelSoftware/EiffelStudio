# Semantics M1IE

This [test](.) is exercising the semantics rule [`M1IE`](../Readme.md).

### Description

In this test, we have an equality expression of the form `c /= d` where `c` and `d` are attached to the same object of type `STRING`. The value of this expression is false because the object is with reference semantics.
