test_name 	evaluate-old-when-retry
test_description A routine has a postcondition which references an "old" expression. The body of the routine raises an exception which is retried by the rescue clause.  When postconditions are monitored and the system is melted, the "old" expression is incorrectly evaluated again when the retry instruction is executed.  Frozen code does not re-evaluate the "old" expression when it does a retry.
