After initial compilation where the system is melted, a parent class
is added to the root class.  This parent has a deferred version of a
feature effected by the root class and the deferred feature has a
precondition and postcondition.  When changes are melted, executing
the system does not execute the precondition or postcondition but it
should.

Discovered in Release 5.0.016.
