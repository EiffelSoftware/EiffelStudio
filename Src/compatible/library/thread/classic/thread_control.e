			-- thread for an OS specific amount of time.

			"C use %"eif_threads.h%""
		alias
			"eif_thr_yield"

			-- The calling thread waits for the current child thread to
			-- terminate.

	native_join (term: POINTER)
			-- Same as `join' except that the low-level architecture-dependent
			-- routine is used. The thread must not be created detached.

feature -- Sleep

	sleep (nanoseconds: INTEGER_64)
			-- Suspend thread execution for interval specified in
			-- `nanoseconds' (1 nanosecond = 10^(-9) second).
