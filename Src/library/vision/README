Before using the vision libraries you must compile
the C libraries in the Clib directory.
There is a Makefile.SH in each subdirectory.

You will need to make sure that the parent directory
for X11/includes is defined or included in the make file.

Then place the archive produced in each subdirectory in the
directory $EIFFEL3/library/vision/spec/$PLATFORM/lib.

This will need to be done on for each platform you will
be running vision on.
