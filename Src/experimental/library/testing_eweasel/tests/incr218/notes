A system has a call to an agent with an open target of type TEST2.
After initial compilation where the system is frozen, execution gives
correct results.  Then the target type of the agent is changed to
`expanded TEST2' and changes are melted.  System execution then dies
with a segmentation fault.

Discovered in release 5.4.0610.
