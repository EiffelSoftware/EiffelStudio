test_name 	 all-chars-debug-key
test_description A system has a debug instruction with every character except null in its debug key.  When the system is melted, the debug instruction is not executed, although it should be.  Freezing produces C code that won't compile.  Finalizing produces code that compiles and executes correctly.
