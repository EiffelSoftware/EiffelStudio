A class inherits twice from a generic class, using DOUBLE and STRING
as the actual generic parameter and renaming the single routine in the
generic class to replicate it.  The system compiles fine, but dies
with a bus error when executed due to the fact that the wrong routine
is being called.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
