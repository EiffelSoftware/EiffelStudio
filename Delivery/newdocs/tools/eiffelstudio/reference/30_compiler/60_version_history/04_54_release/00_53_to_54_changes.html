<H1>Changes between ISE Eiffel 5.3 and ISE Eiffel 5.4:</H1>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



        <H2>What's new</H2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Limited support for new <span class="ekeyword">convert</span> keyword 
          (only on argument passing and assignments. Not yet on infix routines).</li>
          <li>Support for assertion checking on external routines.</li>
          <li>Support for new C/C++ inline specification.</li>
          <li>For .NET, allow calling of overloaded features for a .NET classes 
          to be called without using disambiguated names. Disambiguated names 
          are still needed when redefining inherited features from .NET classes.</li>
          <li>Support for inclusion of .NET resources within Eiffel assemblies.</li>
</ul>
        
        <H2>Improvements</H2>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Improved speed of compilation by about 7-10%</li>
          <li>Reduced waiting time at the end of the degree 6 when performing a 
          compilation from scratch (reduced to about 50% or more of the time it 
          used to take)</li>
          <li>Improved speed of <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span> creation and <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span> access 
          which generates more compact C code.</li>
          <li>Improved speed of agent calls by a factor of 2 to 3.</li>
          <li>Improved speed of Eiffel calls from C (CECIL and use of $ operator 
          on routines) by removing an indirection. It also makes generated 
          executables smaller (about 1-5% smaller)</li>
</ul>
        
        
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        
        
        <h2>Bug fixes</h2>
        
        
        <h3>Language issues</h3>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Now checks for valid export status in agent creation. Meaning that 
          in class <span class="eclass">MY_CLASS</span>, the following agent creation
          <span class="ekeyword">agent</span> <span class="efeature">target</span>.<span class="efeature">call</span> is valid if and 
          only if <span class="efeature">call</span> is exported to <span class="eclass">MY_CLASS</span>.</li>
          <li>Allowed type specification for open operands in agent creation, 
          i.e. one can now write: <span class="ekeyword">agent</span> <span class="efeature">f</span> ({<span class="eclass">A</span>}).</li>
</ul>
        
        
        <h3>Compiler issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed non-detection of changes when changing code from
          <span class="ekeyword">agent</span> <span class="efeature">call </span>to
          <span class="ekeyword">agent</span> <span class="ekeyword">Current</span>.<span class="efeature">call</span>. 
  Which should check for the validity of export of <span class="efeature">call </span>
  to current class.</li>
</ul>
        
        
        <h3>Runtime/code generation issues</h3>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed issue when shared library definition file did not exist or 
          was invalid. Now it will not produce any C compilation errors.</li>
          <li>Fixed bug in recoverable storable when there is a mismatch. The 
          first assignment attempt in 
          <span class="efeature">internal_correct_mismatch</span> from <span class="eclass">ANY</span> would crash.</li>
          <li>Fixed issues when using agents in a multithreaded application, 
          they will sometimes disable the garbage collector and the application 
          might quickly run out of memory.</li>
          <li>Fixed random crashes when EIF_MEMORY_CHUNK, EIF_MEMORY_SCAVENGE 
          and EIF_STACK_CHUNK environment variables had an incorrect value. 
          Instead the runtime will now fix the value to an appropriate one.</li>
</ul>
        
        
        <h3>.NET issues</h3>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bug in code generation  with following statement:<br>
<pre>	l_time: <span class="eclass">TIME_SPAN</span>
	
	<span class="efeature">print</span> (l_time.<span class="efeature">total_milliseconds</span>.<span class="efeature">out</span>)
</pre>
</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
        
        
        <h3>Store/Retrieve issues</h3>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed memory corruption bug with recoverable storable when a 
          mismatch was detected</li>
          <li>Fixed issue where mismatch was not detected if attributes were 
          dropped</li>
</ul>
