A class inherits a feature `weasel: TEST3 [like Current]' where TEST3
is an expanded class.  In an instance of the parent class `weasel' is
non-Void (it better be since it is of an expanded type).  But in the
inheriting class `weasel' is Void, which should be impossible.  If
some Class_type is used as the actual generic parameter, instead of
`like Current', then the attribute is non-Void in both parent and child.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
