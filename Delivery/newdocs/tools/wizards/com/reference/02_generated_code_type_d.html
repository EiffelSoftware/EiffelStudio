		The first dialog asks whether you want to access or to build a component. 
		If you want to access an existing component then the generated code 
		will be for a client. If you choose to build a new one, the generated code 
		will be for a COM server. Choose the server or client check box to specify 
		which kind of project you want to work on. You may specify both in the case 
		where both the component and its client(s) will be written in Eiffel.

		<a name="pgfId_370533"></a>EiffelCOM supports the following
		component executable types:</p>
		<p align="justify"><a name="pgfId_370534"></a>In-Process: These components are
		Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) that will be loaded into the client process. The
		server runs in the same process as the client.</p>
		<p align="justify"><a name="pgfId_370539"></a>Out-of-process: These components
		are executable files that can be accessed through the network. Clients and
		servers run in different processes and may even run on different machines.</p>
		<p align="justify"><a name="pgfId_370561"></a>In-process components are Active-X
		like components; they are usually smaller than local or remote components and
		used by bigger application (often through a high level language). Local
		components run on the same machine as a client. Remote components run on
		different machine and can act as middleware in a three-tier client server
		architecture. Choose the kind of component you want to access or create.</p>
		<p align="justify">If you do not want to compile the generated code
		automatically, check the checkboxes at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
