        <h1>Measurement archive</h1>
        <p>If
        you want to perform measurements on a system that you are building, the
        scopes of interest are the first four listed: Feature, Class,
        Cluster and System. Information on either of these scopes will be
        provided by the development environment (as with ISE Eiffel 5);
        alternatively, you could get it simply by parsing the source of your
        system. But what if you also need quantitative data on other systems, if
        only for purposes of seeing how your results compare to the quantitative
        properties of other people’s work?

        </p>
        <p>It
        would be impractical in this case to require tools that have access to
        as much information on external systems as on your own. All we really
        need is a record of previous measurements on these systems. This
        explains the fifth scope type, Archive: beyond the scope of the
        current system, all we require to define a scope is a <b>measurement
        archive</b>, or just “archive” for short. This is simply a file (or
        part of a file) that retains, in a suitable format (XML-based), the
        results of measurements made earlier on one system. The file
        can be local or accessible as a URL on the Internet.

        </p>
        <p>The
        ability to use a measurement archive as a scope means that:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A
            project may set up a measurement archive as the record of its
            measures.

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>A
            department or company may set up a measurement archive for all
            projects on which it keeps metric information.

            </li>
          <li>The provider of the development environment, such
            as ISE, may publish a set of measurement archives giving metric
            information for reference projects, such as the EiffelBase library
            (designed in part as a showcase of Eiffel technology). ISE indeed
            intends to include a <b>metrics </b>directory, with a set of
            measurement archives for reference tools and libraries, in
            forthcoming releases of ISE Eiffel and at <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/"><span style="color:black">http://eiffel.com</span></a><span style="color:black">.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="color: black">The metric tool provides an easy way to
        create, update or compare archives. By clicking on <img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_sorter_color.gif" width="16" height="16"> , the following
        dialog pops up:</span></p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/metrics_png/archive.png"></p>
        <p align="left">The metric tool automatically creates a sub folder named
        &quot;Metrics&quot; in the current location of the loaded project. It is
        recommended, but not compulsory, to save created archives in that folder,
        since it has been provided for metric needs.</p>
        <span style="color:black">
        <p>We hope that once the facilities described here
        are available users will adopt the practice of publishing measurement
        archives; it’s a way of providing quantitative reference information,
        useful to everyone, without revealing anything critical about the actual
        contents of the software. (For further protection one may envision an
        independent group that anonymizes the data after verifying the
        authenticity of the source.)</p>
