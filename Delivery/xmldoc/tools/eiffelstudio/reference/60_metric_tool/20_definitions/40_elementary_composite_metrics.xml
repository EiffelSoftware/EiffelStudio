	<paragraph>
		<paragraph>Some of our metrics will be elementary and some composite. An elementary metric is measured directly from the product or project record:</paragraph>
		<note>
			<bold>Elementary_metric</bold>
			<line_break/>- An 
			<bold>elementary product metric</bold> is a product metric whose values (integers) indicate the number of occurrences of a certain pattern in a product.
			<line_break/>- An 
			<bold>elementary process metric</bold> is a process metric whose values reflect measurements drawn directly from project records.
		</note>
		<paragraph>An example of elementary product metric is the number of source lines. An example of elementary process metric is the number of incremental compilations of a system.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Elementary metrics are provided by default by the metric tool. There is no means to remove them or to define new ones since they are not expressed as a combination of other metrics.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>From these elementary metrics we may define composite ones:</paragraph>
		<note>
			<bold>Composite metric </bold>: A 
			<bold>composite metric</bold> is a metric whose values are defined by a mathematical formula involving other metrics (elementary, or previously defined composite metrics).
		</note>A later section will introduce a number of operations for defining composite metrics out of elementary ones.
		<paragraph> </paragraph>
		<paragraph>Again we may distinguish between product and process:</paragraph>
		<note>
			<bold>Composite product metric, composite process metric:</bold>
			<line_break/> - A 
			<bold>composite product metric</bold> is a composite metric defined entirely in terms of product metrics.
			<line_break/> - A 
			<bold>composite process metric</bold> is a composite metric whose definition involves one or more process metrics.
		</note>
		<paragraph>By convention, this definition treats as process metric a composite metric involving both product and process components.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The classification introduced for metrics extends to measures, so that we may talk about an elementary product measure, a composite process measure and so on.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The metric menu of the metric tool separates elementary and composite metrics: </paragraph>
