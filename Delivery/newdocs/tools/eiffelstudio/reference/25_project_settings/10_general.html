<h1>General Tab</h1>

<p>This is where you can configure the most general aspects of your system. For
example you can set the name of your application, the default level of assertion
checking, the type of code generated by the Eiffel compiler (normal C code generation/compilation, or .NET
code generation) and
if you are using a precompiled library or not.</p>

<p>Here is what you will see when opening for the first time in a session the
project settings window when using the ace file of the calculator example located
at $ISE_EIFFEL|examples|base|calculator:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, you can specify the application name which will also be the
executable name. With the root class along with the creation procedure name entries
you can select which feature is going to be the root of your execution, in this
case the <span CLASS="efeature">make</span>  feature of class <span CLASS="eclass">CALCULATOR</span> is selected.</p>
<p>You can also choose the default level of assertions. This applies to all
Eiffel classes located in clusters specified in <a href="30_clusters.html">clusters
tab</a>. To override this default on a cluster by cluster basis, you need to go
to the <a href="30_clusters.html">clusters tab</a>. Contrary to ISE Eiffel 4.5,
levels are independent, meaning that one can check the invariants
without checking the preconditions. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once your project is compiled, here is what your general tab looks like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will notice that some options cannot be changed any longer. They are
disabled on purpose. If you want to change these options again you will need
to recompile your project from scratch. To do this, close all EiffelStudio
sessions relative to the project (including the EiffelStudio session you are
working in), open a new EiffelStudio and select <b>Open existing Ace</b> in the
start-up dialog. Select the Ace file of the current project and follow the
steps.</p>
