A system whose root class inherits from a class TEST2 which exists in
two different clusters correctly elicits a VSCN error report from the
compiler.  But when the Ace is changed to indicate a different root
class, which does not depend on TEST2, the compiler still reports a
VSCN error.  If the final versions of the classes are compiled from
scratch, no errors are reported.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
