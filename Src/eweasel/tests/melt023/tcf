test_name 	old-expanded-melted-creations
test_description A class has a routine with a postcondition which references `old arg' where `arg' (the routine's argument) is of an expanded type.  When postconditions are monitored and the system is melted, evaluation of the postcondition appears to incorrectly cause some creations of objects of the expanded type.
