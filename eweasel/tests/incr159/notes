After initial compilation, a constrained generic parameter is added to
root class with unknown actual generic in constraint.  When VTCT error
is corrected, VCFG error is reported since parameter has same name as
a class.  When it is fixed there is a VSRT(1) error since root class
cannot be generic.  After this is corrected, compilation dies in
degree 1.

Discovered in Release 5.0.015.
