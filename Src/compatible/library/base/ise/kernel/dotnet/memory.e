feature -- Removal

	dispose
			-- Action to be executed just before garbage collection
			-- reclaims an object.
			-- Default version does nothing; redefine in descendants
			-- to perform specific dispose actions. Those actions
			-- should only take care of freeing external resources;
			-- they should not perform remote calls on other objects
			-- since these may also be dead and reclaimed.

			-- Free `object', by-passing garbage collection.
			-- Erratic behavior will result if the object is still
			-- referenced.

		end

	mem_free (addr: POINTER)
			-- Free memory of object at `addr'.
			-- (Preferred interface is `free'.)
		do
		end

	full_coalesce
			-- Coalesce the whole memory: merge adjacent free
			-- blocks to reduce fragmentation. Useful, when
			-- a lot of memory is allocated with garbage collector off.
		do
				-- Perform a collection for now.
			{GC}.collect (0)

	collect
			-- Force a partial collection cycle if garbage
			-- collection is enabled; do nothing otherwise.
