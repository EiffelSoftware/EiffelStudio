A pattern of object allocation, resizing and reclamation which was
derived from a simple merge-sort program compiles fine when it is
frozen, but dies with a run-time panic when executed with certain
large values (e.g. 99999).  Many other large values do not cause a
run-time panic.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
