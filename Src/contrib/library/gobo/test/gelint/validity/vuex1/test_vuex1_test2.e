		"Test for validity rule VUEX-1"

	remark: "[
		In this test we call `a' in an inline agent, but `a' is a local variable
		of the enclosing feature.

		ECMA 367-2 gives the choice between two validity rules:
		VPIR-2, section 8.27.11 p.136: "Validity: Inline Agent Requirements"
			An Inline_agent 'a' must satisfy the following conditions:
			2. Every entity appearing in the Attribute_or_routine part of
			   'a' is the name of one of: a formal argument of 'a'; a local
			   variable of 'a'; a feature of the enclosing class; 'Current'.
		VUEX-1, section 8.23.11 p.122: "Validity: Export rule"
			An Object_call appearing in a class C, with `fname' as the feature
			of the call, is export-valid for C if and only if it satisfies
			the following conditions.
			1. `fname' is the final name of a feature of the target type of the call.

		Gobo reports a VUEX-1 error. Note that ISE reports a VEEN error.
