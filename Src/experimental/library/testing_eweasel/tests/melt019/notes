After initial compilation where the system is frozen, an entity name
in a postcondition is changed to the name of a nonexistent entity.
When the compiler reports the VEEN error, the entity name is changed
back to its original value and compilation completes.  But execution
of the resulting system ends with a run-time panic which states
"invalid assertion level".

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
