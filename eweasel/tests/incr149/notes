A system with two classes is compiled.  The compiler detects the
syntax error on the second class.  Then the root class is changed so
that the second class is no longer reachable from the root.  When
compilation is resumed, the compiler still reports a syntax error on
the unreachable class.

Discovered in Release 4.3-18.
