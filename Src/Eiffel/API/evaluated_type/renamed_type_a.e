	description: "[
		Encapsulates a renaming of features together with a type.
		
		It is called renamed type because it carries extensions with it.
		The most prominent case where we use an instance of this class is the following:
		G -> {A rename f as f_of_a end, B rename f as f_of_b end}
		`A' together with its rename clause corresponds to one instance of this class.
