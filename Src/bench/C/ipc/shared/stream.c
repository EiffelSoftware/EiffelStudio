	Maps file descriptor on STREAM structure.

	$Id$

	The motivation for the STREAM structure is to make it easy later to use
	sockets in place of pipes when networking code will be activated. A
	single socket descriptor may be use bidirectionnally, but a pipe is
	only for reading or writing.

	For Windows:
		This form is a little more complex.
		A stream consists of 4 components, 2 pipes and 2 events.
		Each pipe has an event associated with it.
