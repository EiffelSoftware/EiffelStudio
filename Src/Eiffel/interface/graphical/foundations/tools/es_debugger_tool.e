	description: "[
		A shim for EiffelStudio debugger tools, providing access to information required without having to actually initialize the tool.
		
		Note: Descendant shim implementation are created dynamically as such:
              (A) No creation routine should be used, so please mark `default_create' as a non exported creation routine.
              (B) All initialization of the shim should be done by redefining `initialize', where `window' will be available
                  as an attached entity carrying the hosted development window, as will the `edition' number.
              (C) Recycle memory management is handled automatically so there is no need to call `recycle' on this shim or on
                  the created tool.
