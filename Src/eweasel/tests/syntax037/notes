An external routine has a Special_external_decl which casts the
arguments.  If the type to which an argument is cast includes any
parentheses, then the first closing parenthesis in the cast type
incorrectly terminates the argument list in parentheses.  This causes
the compiler to report a syntax error.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
