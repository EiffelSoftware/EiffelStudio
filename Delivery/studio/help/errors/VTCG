     Constrained Genericity rule

     Let `C' be a constrained generic class. A  Class_type
     `CT' having `C' as base class is valid if and only if
     `CT'  satisfies  the  Unconstrained  Genericity  rule
     (VTUG, page 201) and, in addition:

        3  For  any  Formal_generic   parameter   in   the
          declaration  of  `C'  having a constraint of the
          form ->  `D',  the  corresponding  Type  in  the
          Actual_generics list of `CT' conforms to `D'.
