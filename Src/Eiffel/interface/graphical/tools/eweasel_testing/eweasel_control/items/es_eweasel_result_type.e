feature -- Enmueration

	default_type: INTEGER is 0
			-- Not run yet

	failed: INTEGER is 1
			-- Failed
			-- This means test has been successfully launched, but the test result not expected.

	passed: INTEGER is 2
			-- Passed

	error: INTEGER is 3
			-- Error
			-- This means test has not been successfully lanuched.
			-- Maybe due to parse error in eweasel tcf file, etc.
