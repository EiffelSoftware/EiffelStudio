Things we plan to do ouselves (soon!):
-------------------------------------
- eifird  (the interface repository daemon)
- eifnsd  (the Naming Service daemon)
- debugging
- We will strive to implement the POA as soon
  as we have some free capacity. In the process
  the BOA will be completed, since both use the
  same daemon.

Things for which we'd like to find volunteers:
-----------------------------------------------
- DynAny
- other CORBAservices (trader, event, ...)
- porting to other platforms
