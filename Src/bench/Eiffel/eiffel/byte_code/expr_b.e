	is_fast_as_local: BOOLEAN is
			-- Is expression calculation as fast as loading a local?
			-- In other words: does it make sense to store a result of the expression
			-- in a temporary local variable for multiple uses or is it equivalent
			-- in performance to "recalculating" the expression every time?
			-- (In the latter case it's better to avoid creating a temporary
			-- variable to reduce stack memory footprint and register pressure.)

			-- Currently, the only simple expressions are the calls
			-- the manifest strings and the constants.

	is_hector: BOOLEAN is
			-- Is the current expression an hector one ?

			-- of an external function call, <E> is of the form $<A> and <A>
			-- is an attribute or a local variable.

	has_gcable_variable: BOOLEAN is
			-- Does the expression have a GCable variable ?
