test_name 	expanded-list-like-current
test_description A class has a routine which prints `t.count' where `t' is of type `expanded LINKED_LIST [like Current]'.  The root class, which is expanded, inherits this routine and makes it a creation procedure.  If the system is melted, execution dies with a segmentation fault. Frozen code works fine.
