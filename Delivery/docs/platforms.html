<h1><a NAME="Windows"></a>Windows</h1>

<blockquote>ISE products run smoothly on Windows 95/98/NT/2000. Look at
the <a href="papers/c_compilers.html">C compilers</a> pages to know more
about Windows requirements.
<p>Due to the way Windows 95/98 manage the graphical user resources you
will notice sometimes that some icons of EiffelBench, EiffelCase or EiffelBuild
will disappear. This just means that you are running too low on graphical
user resources, closing some applications should fix the problem.</blockquote>

<a NAME="Linux"></a>Linux&nbsp;</h1>

<h2>
<a NAME="linuxglibc"></a>Linux-glibc&nbsp;</h2>

<blockquote>This version of ISE Eiffel was built using the 2.0.34 version
of the kernel using glibc-2.0.7 and elf format.&nbsp;
<p>If you are using an environment as described above you should set the
PLATFORM environment variable to `<b>linux-glibc</b>'. If you plan to release
your software on different version of the Linux OS you should statically
link your application, otherwise it may not work as expected on different
versions of the Linux kernel.&nbsp;
<h3>
`eifid' doesn't return a valid value</h3>

<blockquote>Make sure your machine is configured as a "network" machine
and not as a standalone machine even if no network card is installed. There
should be a valid entry in the "/etc/hosts" file for the local host.
<p>Make sure a command like "ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1" is also executed at
boot time. If you type /sbin/ifconfig, you should see something like:&nbsp;
<blockquote>lo Link encap:Local Loopback&nbsp;
<br>inet addr:127.0.0.1 Bcast:127.255.255.255 Mask:255.0.0.0

<br>TX packets:1050 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h3>
<br>
BUG with the backspace key</h3>

<blockquote>Under certain linux configurations, the BackSpace key has a
strange behaviour within ebench: it deletes the character before the cursor,
then moves the cursor to right. This bug hasn't been fixed yet, but there
is a workaround. Add these two lines into your .Xdefaults file (you may
have to perform a "xrdb .Xdefaults" if you don't launch X again after the
modification):
<p>ebench*XmText*Translations: \
<br>override &lt;Key>osfBackSpace: delete-previous-character() backward-character()&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h3>
<br>
XKeysymDB problem</h3>

<blockquote>You may experience trouble while trying to use the BackSpace
key. If so, you have to check that the file /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB has
the definition of the osf symbols, which should be the case if you have
installed Motif properly. When you have this file correct, and if you still
cannot use the BackSpace key, you will have to try the following command:
<p>xmodmap -e "keysym Delete = BackSpace"
<p>Check with your xmodmap man page.
<p>Note that you may want to add this command to your configuration files
so that this is done each time you run your X server.

variable PLATFORM:

Also, add to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH the path to the Eiffel run-time shared
libraries.
<blockquote>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $EIFFEL5/bench/spec/$PLATFORM/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</blockquote>
The version has been compiled on Digital Unix 4.0D. The C configuration
file uses cc as default compiler.&nbsp;
<p>ISE EiffelBench doesn't support any multithreaded mechanism on Digital
Unix. However, you can compile multi-threaded programs using the POSIX
libraries, since ISE Eiffel 4.5 provides with Beta-test multi-threaded
run-times.&nbsp;

<h1>
<a NAME="Solaris24"></a>Solaris 2.4</h1>

<blockquote>This note does not apply to any version other than Solaris
2.4.
<ul>
<li>
C compiler:</li>

<br>You cannot use the C compiler shipped with non development system since
it is only used to rebuild the kernel.
<br>If you have installed the SPROcc package, the default location for
the C compiler is /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc.
<li>
Displaying on another Sun machine: When running the Solaris 2.4 version
of EiffelBench on a computer, do not display on another Sun computer running
Open Windows. This may crash the X server on that other computer. This
bug occurs somewhat randomly (usually only in the second consecutive execution
of EiffelBench) and does not arise for any platform other than Solaris
2.4. We have not yet been able to determine what causes it.</li>

<p><br>The following do NOT cause any problem:
<br>- Running on a Solaris computer and displaying on the same computer
(the most common case).
<br>- Running on a Solaris computer and displaying on a non-Sun computer.
<br>- Executing other tools of the environment, in particular EiffelBuild.</ul>
