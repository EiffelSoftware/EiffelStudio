		<H1>EiffelVision 2 Containers</H1>
			<P>
			All vision2 containers inherit <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_container_chart.html">EV_CONTAINER</A>
			</P>
		<H2>What is a container?</h2>
		<P>
		A container is a vision2 widget that may contain other widgets. Some containers such as <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_cell_chart.html">EV_CELL</A>
		may only hold one widget while containers such as <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_box_chart.html">EV_BOX</A> may hold multiple widgets. As a container is
		of type <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chart.html">EV_WIDGET</A>, this means that a container may be placed within a container.&nbsp;
        A list of the classes held within the container cluster can be found <a href="../../../reference/interface/widgets/containers/index.html">here</a>.&nbsp;
        Windows inherit from EV_CELL and are therefore classed as containers
        also.
		</P>
        <P CLASS="note"><B>Note: </B>Containers may only contain other
        widgets.&nbsp; Items may only be placed in certain primitives.&nbsp; For
        example, an EV_LIST_ITEM may be contained in an EV_LIST.</P>
		<H2>Inheritance from Base</h2>
		<P>
		Wherever possible, Vision2 containers reuse the container structures
        provided by Base. This provides three main advantages:
			<OL>
				<LI>Familiarity for operations such as access, insertions and removals. Anybody who already uses <A HREF="/libraries/base/index.html">Base</A> should
				find it easy to adapt to using Vision2 containers.
				<LI>The underlying structures used have been tried and tested for many years and their design has been proved to be robust and effective.
				<LI>It provides powerful methods of querying the contents. In the original Vision library, you needed to keep reference to widgets
				as you could not query the contents of a container.
			</OL>
		<P>For example, <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_container_chart.html">EV_CONTAINER</A> inherits <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/base/reference/structures/storage/box_chart.html">BOX</A> and
		<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/base/reference/structures/access/collection_chart.html">COLLECTION</A>. Descendents of <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_container_chart.html">EV_CONTAINER</A> such as
		<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_box_chart.html">EV_BOX</A> may also inherit other structures from <A HREF="/libraries/base/index.html">Base</A>.
		<P>&nbsp;
		<H2>Usage of Containers</H2>
        <P>The main role of a container is to position its children in a certain
        way, an EV_HORIZONTAL_BOX for example positions it children side by side
        along the horizontal axis, to get vertical stacking you would use an
        EV_VERTICAL_BOX.<P>&nbsp;<P>An code example of adding widgets to a container
        is as follows.
          <blockquote>
          <P>
        <A CLASS="code">
        add_to_container is<BR>
        local <BR>  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a_window: EV_TITLED_WINDOW<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a_hbox: EV_HORIZONTAL_BOX<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a_button: EV_BUTTON<BR>
        do<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create a_window  <BR>      
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create a_hbox        <BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create a_button.make_with_text (&quot;Button1&quot;)<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hbox.extend (a_button)<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hbox.extend (create {EV_BUTTON}.make_with_text (&quot;Button2&quot;))<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hbox.extend (create {EV_BUTTON}.make_with_text (&quot;Button3&quot;))<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a_window.extend (a_hbox)<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a_window.show<BR>
        end<BR>
        </blockquote>
        </A>
        
		<H2>Sizing of containers</H2>
		As <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_container_chart.html">EV_CONTAINER</A> is of type <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chart.html">EV_WIDGET</A>, the following
        facilities are provided for setting the minimum size : <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_set_minimum_width">set_minimum_width</A>, 
		<A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_set_minimum_height">set_minimum_height</A> and <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_set_minimum_size">set_minimum_size</A>.
		It is important to remember that as a general rule, <B>the current size of a container is always at least the minimum size of all its contents.</B>
		<P CLASS="note"><B>Note: </B>The exception to this is: <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_fixed_chart.html">EV_FIXED</A>,
		<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_viewport_chart.html">EV_VIEWPORT</A> and <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_scrollable_area_chart.html">EV_SCROLLABLE_AREA</A> which do actually allow
		their contents to be larger than their current size.</P>
