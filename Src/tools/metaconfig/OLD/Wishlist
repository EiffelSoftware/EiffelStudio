*** List of wishes for dist version 3.0 ***

=======================================================================
If you wish to implement one of the following, you're welcome :-). In
that case, please let me know about it.  I will probably integrate your
changes in my version (after some sanity checks, because I can't
maintain something I don't understand).

This list has no priority order whatsoever, so you may pick up one of
the following suggestion and start working on it. In that case, you
may want to get all the official patches for dist 3.0 first and make
sure nobody is already working on that topic.
=======================================================================

*** jmake

Make the names used more uniform. For instance, 'Simple' appears in
many rules, but with different meanings, thus making the Jmakefile
harder to understand at a first glance.

Allow per-system compilation rules, so that objects and source file
do not inter-mix but are kept in separate directories.

*** metaconfig

Write some "generic" templates for writing new units, so that the user
only needs to fill up some fields. For instance, there could be a
template for d_* and i_* units. [That's done, they are under mcon/files.
Now I only need to write the generator on top of them]

Make Configure know about cross-compiling.

Make Configure know about VPATH for separate object directory, with
proper support from jmake.

Implement the ?I: and ?L: lines. The ?I: fills in inclwanted for you,
while ?L: fills in the libswanted variable. For instance, when using
a socket() call, one may need to look at -lbsd. If d_socket.U lists
'bsd' within its ?L: line, then the libswanted variable will be
correctly set. [Note: there are some hooks for this already]

Build a library of PD routines that may be otherwise missing on
some older systems, eg: getopt(). Those routines will be automagically
added to the package by relying on ?P: lines, something like:

	?P:getopt (HAS_GETOPT): getopt.c

which would include getopt.c in the package (under some PD dir)
when getopt is used and HAS_GETOPT is *not* used within the sources,
in order to achieve transparent implementation.

*** metalint

Process '@' pre-processor lines, and signal mismatches, unrecognized
commands, etc... Also warn when testing wantedness of unknown symbols
or obsolete ones, etc...

*** pat tools

Clean that stuff.
