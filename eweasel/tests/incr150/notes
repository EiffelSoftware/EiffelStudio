After initial compilation, a VEEN error is introduced by changing an
identifier in a class invariant.  When the compiler detects it, the
error is removed and compilation resumes and finishes normally.  But a
subsequent attempt to freeze the system with no further changes causes
the compiler to die.

Discovered in Release 4.3-19.
