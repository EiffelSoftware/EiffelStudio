Gobo Eiffel, version 3.9

One of the main concerns of Gobo Eiffel is to provide you with Eiffel
libraries and tools that are portable across various Eiffel compilers
available on the market. That way, you can still use your favorite
Eiffel compiler while taking advantage of the goodies included in
this package.

The software included in this package is copyrighted freeware
distributed under the terms and conditions of the MIT License as
specified in file License.txt. Gobo Eiffel is a multi-developer
open-source project whose development is hosted at SourceForge
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/gobo-eiffel/) while the official site
(for stable releases) is still located at http://www.gobosoft.com/.

Note that this release is not a full-fledged version. In particular
some of its documentation is out of date or missing. It was decided to
build this package anyway because it contains a lot of new library classes
and a couple of new tools which have already been in use for several months
by other Eiffel projects. So now that the code of these tools and Eiffel
libraries is stable, it was deemed useful to make it available in an
official package rather that still requiring those third party Eiffel
projects to tell their users to download the development version of Gobo
under Git. The next releases will be devoted to making the documentation
more uptodate and providing more tests and examples.

This package consists of fourteen Eiffel libraries:

    . Gobo Eiffel Argument Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Structure Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Lexical Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Parse Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Pattern Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Regexp Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Math Library
    . Gobo Eiffel String Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Test Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Time Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Tools Library
    . Gobo Eiffel Utility Library
    . Gobo Eiffel XML Library

and nine utilities:

    . Gobo Eiffel Compiler (gec)
    . Gobo Eiffel Ant (geant)
    . Gobo Eiffel Xace (gexace)
    . Gobo Eiffel Lex (gelex)
    . Gobo Eiffel Yacc (geyacc)
    . Gobo Eiffel Test (getest)
    . Gobo Eiffel XSLT Processor (gexslt)
    . Gobo Eiffel Lint (gelint)
    . Gobo Eiffel Preprocessor (gepp)

Note that these utilities are not needed if you just want to use the
library classes provided in this package (unless you got the classes
from Git).

The software provided in this distribution should work on any platform
where supported Eiffel compilers are available. However this software
has only been tested under Windows XP and Linux. Since most Eiffel compilers
use the notation $NAME for environment variables in their Ace files
(or equivalent), this convention has been used instead of the Windowish
%NAME%. Likewise, the directory separator used through out this distribution
is /, following Unix/Linux convention instead of the Windows \ separator.

To install this package, please follow the instructions below:

Under Windows:

    . download the package gobo39-src.7z or gobo39-src.zip
    . copy the files to a directory of your choice on your disk and
      set the environment variable %GOBO% to that directory, known as
      the distribution directory. Also put the directory %GOBO%\bin
      in your PATH.
    . execute the script:
          %GOBO%\install.bat <c_compiler>
      where <c_compiler> is a C compiler installed on your computer
      (for example use "msc" for Microsoft C compiler).

Under Unix/Linux:

    . download the package gobo39-src.tar.gz
    . copy the files to a directory of your choice on your disk and
      set the environment variable $GOBO to that directory, known as
      the distribution directory. Also put the directory $GOBO/bin
      in your PATH.
    . execute the script:
          $GOBO/install.sh <c_compiler>
      where <c_compiler> is a C compiler installed on your computer
      (for example use "gcc" for GNU C compiler).

Note that if you downloaded this package from Git on SourceForge:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/gobo-eiffel/

or on GitHub:

    http://github.com/gobo-eiffel/gobo/

you will need to bootstrap it. Please read $GOBO/work/bootstrap/Readme.txt.

The supported Eiffel compilers, in alphabetical order, are: Gobo Eiffel
Compiler (gec) 3.9, ISE Eiffel 6.3.7.5660 (Classic and .NET).
For more details about the supported Eiffel compilers, please see the file
"Release_notes.txt". This software might work with other Eiffel compilers
and/or other compiler versions, however no test has been done. To have
a better understanding of the way this software has been designed and
implemented, you can also have a look at "$GOBO/doc/portability".

Each of the above directories comes with a Readme file providing
some basic information. Documentation is also available on the Web
at http://www.gobosoft.com/. Check it out regularly for updates, bug
fixes, workarounds and new releases. You can also subscribe to the
Gobo Eiffel mailing list (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gobo-eiffel/)
and take part to the discussions or ask your questions there. Another
mailing list (http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gobo-eiffel-develop)
for discussions about the features under development in the Git version
is hosted at SourceForge.

Although the license allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with
this software, we would be grateful to get your feedbacks, bug reports
and/or bug fixes, improvements, etc. so that others could benefit from
your work and ideas as well. We would also be interested in hearing about
your projects and how easy (or difficult) it was to adapt this software
for your specific needs. Thank you in advance.
