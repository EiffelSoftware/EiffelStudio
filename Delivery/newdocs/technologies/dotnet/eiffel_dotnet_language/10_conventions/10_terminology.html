		<h1>Eiffel Terminology</h1>

		<h2>Eiffel Terminology Defined for C# and VB.NET Programmers</h2>
		<p>Eiffel programmers feel that it is important to have a set of precise terms with 
			which to communicate about our method of software development. Like everything 
			else in Eiffel, the use of certain terms is not accidental. They were chosen 
			carefully to impart particular meaning. Many of the Terms that Eiffel 
			programmers use are different from those used by&nbsp;developers 
			using&nbsp;other object-oriented languages. But that does not mean that their 
			meanings will be foreign to you. If you have some understanding of 
			object-oriented technology, you will find that in many cases the Eiffel terms 
			describe concepts with which you were already familiar, just under different 
			names, and possibly with slightly different meanings.
		</p>
		<p>The intention of this glossary is to give you a list of these terms with 
			extended definitions that will relate the Eiffel terms to language with which 
			you may be more familiar. Also, you will find an occasional term which comes 
			from other programming cultures but is not used in Eiffel.

			<TR>
				<A NAME="ancestors"></A>
				<TD>Ancestors</TD>
				<TD>The set of Classes from which a particular Class Inherits, including the Class 
					itself. Somewhat analogous to Bases and Interfaces in C# and VB.NET (see Proper 
					Ancestors).</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="argument"></A>
				<TD>Argument</TD>
				<TD>An object which is passed to a routine. Called a Parameter in C# and VB.NET.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="assertion"></A>
				<TD>Assertion</TD>
				<TD>A declaritive expression that evaluates to true or false. Assertions in Eiffel 
					are of different types and are used primarily for expressing software 
					specification to potential Reuse Consumers and ensuring that executing software 
					complies with specification. Any violation of an assertion causes an exception, 
					and is generally indicative of a defect in the software system.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<tr>
				<A NAME="attribute"></A>
				<td>Attribute</td>
				<td>A Feature which represents storage used in every instance of a class. Used like 
					a Field member in C#.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<A NAME="class"></A>
				<td>Class</td>
				<td>Software text which is the static definition of a Type (or the pattern for a 
					Type in the case of a Generic Class). Used in very nearly the same way as in 
					C#. In C# Classes are used for reference types and Structures for value types. 
					In Eiffel, Classes are used for both, but see Expanded Class.</td>
			</tr>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="class invariant"></A>
				<TD>Class Invariant</TD>
				<TD>An Assertion on a Class which defines the valid or stable state for objects 
					which are instances of the Class. All instances of the Class must comply with 
					the Class Invariant at any time that they are accessible to Clients.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="client"></A>
				<TD>Client</TD>
				<TD>A Class whose role is that of Client in a Client/Supplier Relationship with 
					another Class.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="client/supplier relationship"></A>
				<TD>Client/Supplier Relationship</TD>
				<TD>One of the two Relationships that can exist between Classes. Client/Supplier is 
					characterized by a situation in which one Class, called the Client, has or 
					uses, instances of the other Class, called the Supplier. For example, if class 
					"X" declares an entity "y" of type STRING, then Class X becomes a Client to 
					Class STRING as a result. At the same time, Class STRING becomes a Supplier to 
					class X.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="cluster"></A>
				<TD>Cluster</TD>
				<TD>A group of classes (or recursively, clusters) which share some criteria which 
					justifies their being grouped together. Classes are usually clustered together 
					because they model similar entities or have similar functionality. For example, 
					in the Eiffel Base Library, there is a cluster called "structures" which 
					contains clusters for data structures. One cluster is "list" which contains 
					classes like LINKED_LIST and TWO_WAY_LIST. Another "structures" cluster is 
					"dispensers" which contains classes like "ARRAYED_STACK" and "PRIORITY_QUEUE". 
					When .NET assemblies are made available to Eiffel programmers, each assembly is 
					viewed as a cluster.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="command"></A>
				<TD>Command</TD>
				<TD>
					<P>A Class Feature which can change the state of the instance to which it is 
						applied, and does not return a result. It is the Reuse Consumer's view of a 
						Procedure.</P>
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="contract"></A>
				<TD>Contract</TD>
				<TD>Like a contract between human parties, a software Contract is a formal 
					agreement between software components, Classes in the case of Eiffel. The 
					contract is written in the Assertions of a Supplier Class and specifies in 
					precise terms those conditions with which potential Clients may interact with 
					the Supplier. The contract for a particular Class is composed of the contracts 
					for each Exported Routine of the Class as well as the Class Invariant.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="creation procedure"></A>
				<TD>Creation Procedure</TD>
				<TD>A Procedure which can be used to initialize and instance of a Class. Similar to 
					a Constructor in C# or VB.NET, but slightly different. A Creation Procedure can 
					be applied when an object is being created, but can also be applied later to 
					reinitialize an existing object (such is not the case with Constructors). Also, 
					Creation Procedures are responsible for ensuring that newly created objects 
					comply with their Class Invariants.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="deferred class"></A>
				<TD>Deferred Class</TD>
				<TD>A class which has at least one Deferred Feature.&nbsp;The term "Deferred" is 
					used in the Eiffel culture like the term "Abstract" in .NET.&nbsp;Like an 
					abstract class in C# or VB.NET, it is not possible to make direct runtime 
					instances of a Deferred Class.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="deferred feature"></A>
				<TD>Deferred Feature</TD>
				<TD>A Class Feature which has not implementation. Like a virtual method in C#. Can 
					apply to Commands or Queries.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="descendants"></A>
				<TD>Descendants</TD>
				<TD>The set of all Classes which Inherit from a particular Class, including the 
					Class itself. Somewhat analogous to subclasses in C# and VB.NET (see Proper 
					Descendants).</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="design by contract"></A>
				<TD>Design by Contract</TD>
				<TD>A method of developing software in which a System is composed of&nbsp;a set of 
					interacting&nbsp;Classes which cooperate based upon precisely defined 
					Contracts.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="direct instance"></A>
				<TD>Direct Instance</TD>
				<TD>A runtime Object of some type, based directly on the definition from a specific 
					Effective Class. See Instance for more information. Usually used in conjunction 
					with the class name, e.g. "an instance of class POLYGON".
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="effective class"></A>
				<TD>Effective Class</TD>
				<TD>A Class which has no Deferred Features. Only if a Class is Effective can it 
					have direct runtime instances. Effective classes are called Concrete Classes in 
					some programming cultures.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="eiffel metadata consumer"></A>
				<TD>Eiffel Metadata Consumer</TD>
				<TD>Applicable to&nbsp;Eiffel for .NET only, this is a mechanism that works behind 
					the scenes to make Types from .NET assemblies available to Eiffel programmers. 
					The Metadata Consumer reconciles the differences between the naming conventions 
					of Eiffel and .NET by providing an Eiffel compliant view of the Types in .NET 
					assemblies.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="expanded class"></A>
				<TD>Expanded Class</TD>
				<TD>Like a value type in C#, but with some restrictions. .NET value types are 
					viewed to Eiffel programmers as Expanded Classes. For reference types, an 
					object field holds a reference to a runtime object (or is Void). For value 
					types, the object field holds the fields of the runtime object. A Type based on 
					an Expanded Class is an Expanded Type.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="exported feature"></A>
				<TD>Exported Feature</TD>
				<TD>A Feature which is available to Client Classes. Analogous to "public" in C# and 
					VB.NET. However, Exporting in Eiffel has fine granularity. It is possible to 
					make certain Features available to Clients of all types or only to Clients 
					which conform to certain named Classes (vs Public, Protected, Private)</TD>
			</TR>
			<tr>
				<A NAME="feature"></A>
				<td>Feature</td>
				<td>Any of a Class's Attributes or Routines. Used similarly to the term Member as 
					in C#. In Eiffel class features can be only Attributes or Routines.</td>
			</tr>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="feature application"></A>
				<TD>Feature Application</TD>
				<TD>The process of using the Class Features on instances of the Class. The model 
					for Feature Application is "x.f(a,...)" where "x" is an entity which will be 
					attached to some object at runtime, "f" is some Feature of the Class on which x 
					is based, and "a,..." is an optional list of arguments which may be appropriate 
					for some Routines. Feature "f" is "applied" to the object attached to "x". 
					Feature Application may involve calling Routines, or may only involve returning 
					the value of an Attribute from memory. Feature application is sometimes called 
					"feature call".</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="function"></A>
				<TD>Function</TD>
				<TD>A Routine that returns a result. In C# function results can be typed as "void", 
					meaning that there is no result returned. Eiffel functions cannot be typed 
					"void" (see Procedure). All Functions must specify a result type. Of course, if 
					the result type is a reference type, there could be cases in which the 
					reference resulting from some specific&nbsp;call&nbsp;might be Void.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="generic class"></A><A NAME="genericity"></A>
				<TD>Generic Class</TD>
				<TD>A Class which is written using parameters to represent other Classes or Types 
					to enhance its reusability. For example, the Class LINKED_LIST [G] is a generic 
					class in which "G" represents some other Class. So, LINKED_LIST is written 
					independent of the items an instance of the list will hold. We cannot declare a 
					LINKED_LIST without specifiying a Class to substitute for "G". If we want a 
					list of cats we can declare one by using the Type: LINKED_LIST [CAT]. Generic 
					Classes are not currently implemented in .NET, so there's no corresponding 
					concept in C#.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="inheritance"></A>
				<TD>Inheritance</TD>
				<TD>One of the two Relationships that can exist between Classes. If Class B 
					inherits from Class A, then every feature in Class A is potentially available 
					to instances of Class B. Also, when ever an instance of Class A is required, an 
					instance of Class B will suffice. Inheritance is used in Eiffel much the same 
					as in C#. The Eiffel model allows full, controlled multiple inheritance, 
					though. Eiffel Classes may inherit from multiple Concrete Classes and name 
					clashes are handled through a process called Feature Adaptation.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="heir"></A>
				<TD>Heir</TD>
				<TD>The adjacent Proper Descendants of a Class. If class C inherits from class B 
					and class B inherits from class A, then class A's Proper Descendants include B 
					and C, but A's Heirs only include B.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="instance"></A>
				<TD>Instance</TD>
				<TD>A runtime Object of some type, based on the definition from a Class. Usually 
					used in conjunction with the class name, e.g. "an instance of class POLYGON". 
					In contrast with Direct Instance, an Instance of class POLYGON is a Direct 
					Instance of POLYGON or any Proper Descendant of POLYGON such, perhaps, as 
					RECTANGLE. So it its possible to have Objects which are Instances of Deferred 
					Classes, but it is impossible to have Objects which are Direct Instances of 
					Deferred Classes.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="interface"></A>
				<TD>Interface</TD>
				<TD>Not supported as such in Eiffel. Used in C# and VB.NET, Interfaces provide sets 
					of specific Class Features which must be effected by any Concrete Class that 
					"implements" the Interface. There is no concept of Interface in Eiffel that is 
					separate from the concept of Class. So, Interfaces from .NET appear to Eiffel 
					programmers to be completely Deferred (abstract) Classes.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="manifest string"></A>
				<TD>Manifest String</TD>
				<TD>A quoted string used in source code, for example the "Hello World!" in:
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my_string := "Hello World!"</p>
					This is often called a "literal" string in other languages. In Eiffel, the 
					quoted string "Hello World!" above&nbsp;is, by virtue of its presence, an 
					instance of the Eiffel STRING class. In Eiffel there are manifest constants of 
					other types as well, like numbers coded&nbsp;explicitly in software text, 
					&nbsp;and the keywords True and False as the manifest booleans.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="module"></A>
				<TD>Module</TD>
				<TD>A syntactical grouping of software text. Source code is divided into Modules in 
					order to help organize it in some meaningful way or to achieve some goal.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="object"></A>
				<TD>Object</TD>
				<TD>An instance of a Class during system execution. As such, Objects only exist at 
					runtime.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="overloading"></A>
				<TD>Overloading</TD>
				<TD>Not supported in Eiffel. Overloading is the ability to have more than one 
					Feature with the same name, varying only by the Types of its Arguments. 
					Overloading is supported by the underlying object model in .NET.&nbsp;As a 
					result&nbsp;many classes in .NET assemblies have overloaded methods. The Eiffel 
					Metadata Consumer disambiguates the overloaded names so that by the time you 
					see them in the Eiffel context they appear no longer to be overloaded.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="parent"></A>
				<TD>Parent</TD>
				<TD>The adjacent Proper Ancestors of a Class. If class C inherits from class B and 
					class B inherits from class A, then class C's Proper Ancestors include A and B, 
					but C's Parents only include B.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="postcondition"></A>
				<TD>Postcondition</TD>
				<TD>An assertion coded on a Routine which defines the conditions will be true upon 
					successful completion of the Routine. It is the responsibility of the Routine 
					to ensure that the Postcondition holds after the Routine executes.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="precondition"></A>
				<TD>Precondition</TD>
				<TD>An assertion coded on a Routine which defines the conditions under which the 
					Routine can complete successfully. It is the responsibility of the Client to 
					ensure that the Precondition holds before attempting to call the Routine.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="procedure"></A>
				<TD>Procedure</TD>
				<TD>A Routine that does not return a result. Much like a "void" function in C#.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="proper ancestors"></A>
				<TD>Proper Ancestors</TD>
				<TD>The set of all Classes&nbsp;from which&nbsp;a particular Class Inherits, 
					excluding the Class itself.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="proper descendants"></A>
				<TD>Proper Descendants</TD>
				<TD>The set of all Classes which Inherit from a particular Class, excluding the 
					Class itself.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="query"></A>
				<TD>Query</TD>
				<TD>A Class Feature which returns information from the instance to which it is 
					applied. Queries are the Reuse Consumer's view of Attributes and Functions.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<TD>Reference Type</TD>
				<A NAME="reference type"></A>
				<TD>A type whose instances are accessed via a reference. For reference types, an 
					object field holds a reference to a runtime object (or is Void). This is in 
					contrast to&nbsp;value types, in which case, the object field holds the fields 
					of the runtime object. In Eiffel, reference types are based on reference 
					classes, i.e.,&nbsp;any class which is not an Expanded Class.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="relationship"></A>
				<TD>Relationship</TD>
				<TD>An association between two classes. There are only two types of Relationships 
					that can exist between classes: Client/Supplier and Inheritance.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="reuse consumer"></A>
				<TD>Reuse Consumer</TD>
				<TD>The role&nbsp;a&nbsp;software engineer assumes when in the process of making 
					use of Classes or Types already in existence. As a reuse consumer, the engineer 
					is interested primarily in the specification of those Classes or Types being 
					used, rather than their implementation.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="reuse producer"></A>
				<TD>Reuse Producer</TD>
				<TD>The role a&nbsp;software engineer assumes when&nbsp;in the process or creating 
					a new Class.&nbsp;In this role the engineer attempts to&nbsp;produce a product 
					which will be reusable by&nbsp;him or herself and other engineers in the 
					future.&nbsp;In the Eiffel culture, whenever a software engineer creates a 
					class, it is as a Reuse Producer, and with the thought that each new class has 
					the potential to become reusable.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="root class"></A>
				<TD>Root Class</TD>
				<TD>For any System, the Class which will be instantiated to start the system. 
					Specified by project settings.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="root procedure"></A>
				<TD>Root Procedure</TD>
				<TD>A Creation Procedure of the Root Class of a System which will be applied to an 
					initial instance of the Root Class at System startup. Similar to Main() in C# 
					and VB.NET, but with the important difference that the fact that a particular 
					Creation Procedure&nbsp;is the Root Procedure for a System is not define in the 
					Class itself as with Main(). Rather, it is specified outside the Class in 
					project settings. This helps Reuse Producers keep Classes more autonomous and 
					therefore potentially more reusable.</TD>
			</TR>
			<tr>
				<A NAME="routine"></A>
				<td>Routine</td>
				<td>A computational Class Feature which is either a Function or Procedure. Routines 
					are the executable parts of a Class. Routines are similar to Methods in C#.</td>
			</tr>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="software specification"></A>
				<TD>Software Specification</TD>
				<TD>A statement of how a software element is to be used and what it will do when 
					executed. Ideally, this is stated in terms that do not betray how the software 
					does what it does.
					<p>
						In Eiffel, specification is included in the code, rather than a separate 
						document. For a routine, it consists of its call signature and its contract. 
						For a class, it consists of the signatures and contracts for all public 
						features.
					</p>
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="supplier"></A>
				<TD>Supplier</TD>
				<TD>A Class whose role is that of Supplier in a Client/Supplier Relationship with 
					another Class.</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="system"></A>
				<TD>System</TD>
				<TD>A set of Classes related by the two Relationships which can be compiled to 
					produce an executable.
				</TD>
			</TR>
			<TR>
				<A NAME="type"></A>
				<TD>Type</TD>
				<TD>The description of a set of Objects equipped with certain Features.</TD>
