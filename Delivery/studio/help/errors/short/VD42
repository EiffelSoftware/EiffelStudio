Lace error: precompiled directory/file is unreadable.
What to do: make sure that the directory/file exists and that appropriate
  permissions are set ("read" for files, "read/execute" for directories).

  You can also download a set of precompiled libraries from our web site
  at http://eiffel.com/download.
