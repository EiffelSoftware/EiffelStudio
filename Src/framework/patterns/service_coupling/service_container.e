	description: "[
		Base implementation for all global and local service containers.
		
		Note: Containers must obey some rules.
		
		* When prompting services must be registed with the global service provider ({SERVICE_HEAP}).
		  Promoting is the act of promoting a service to the highest level possible. This attribute
		  only needs to be respected when using chained containers {SERVICE_CHAINED_CONTAINER}.
		  The global service container may be retrieved using the {SERVICE_CONTAINER} service and then
		  global service provider using {SERVICE_PROVIDER}.
		* Services that are not promoted may have a localized versions of the service, if not already
		  proffered. When querying for a service a local service is given priority. Clients are free
		  to query for the global service provider {SERVICE_PROVIDER} or {SERVICE_CONTAINER}.
		  
		It's not guarenteed that querying for {SERVICE_PROVIDER} or {SERVICE_CONTAINER} will return
		the global versions of those services. These may also be localized services.
