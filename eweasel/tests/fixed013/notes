Compiling a system, adding `class' to the indexing clause, recompiling
and then removing `class' from indexing clause when syntax error is
reported causes exception trace.

Fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.  However, if the keyword class appears
in the indexing part, compiler reports VD20 violation (gets confused
about what the name of the class really is).
