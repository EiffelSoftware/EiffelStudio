		<paragraph>Users should have the ability to define a new derived or composite metric by applying some of the selection criteria or composition operators to one or more existing metrics.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>They should also have the ability to save all current metric definitions to a file, producing a 
			<bold>metric definition record</bold>. This should not be confused with a measurement archive, which records the results of measures resulting from applying certain metrics to certain projects.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Although the concepts are distinct, EiffelStudio lets you store a measurement archive and the corresponding metric definition record into a single file, so that when you access the archived measures you have an unambiguous definition of the metrics that served to produce them.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The environment must also provide a way of adding a set of metrics read from a metric definition record, available from a local file, to the current metric definitions. As a result, users will be able to benefit from each other's metric definitions and improve them over time.</paragraph>
