test_name 	 remove-ace-object-clause
test_description A system is compiled with an Ace file which specifies a nonexistent library via `object: "-lweasel"'.  Then the `object' clause is removed completely from the Ace and system is melted.  When the previously generated C code is compiled, it won't link because the (nonexistent) library is still referenced.
