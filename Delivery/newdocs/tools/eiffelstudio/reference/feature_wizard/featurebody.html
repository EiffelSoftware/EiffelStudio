		<P>What goes into the feature body field is dependent on what kind of feature you wish to generate.</P>

		<UL>
		<LI><B>do</B>:
		this is the normal procedure type. Enter in the field below <B>do</B> a body for your feature.

		<CODE><PRE>do_something is
    do
        a := b
    end</PRE></CODE>

		<LI><B>once</B>:
		this is the type for a routine that is executed once per execution. As a once routine cannot have arguments, it is disabled when you added one or more arguments.

		<CODE><PRE>init is
    once
        load
    end</PRE></CODE>

		<LI><B>deferred</B>:
		this creates a routine of deferred type. The local and body fields grey out as they serve no use anymore.

		<CODE><PRE>do_something is
    deferred
    end</PRE></CODE>

		<LI><B>external</B>:
		this creates an Eiffel wrap routine around a routine written in another language. Use the body field to enter a string containing the necessary information about the routine using the external syntax.

		<CODE><PRE>do_something is
    external
        "C | %"location.h%""
    end</PRE></CODE>
