<H1>Major changes between ISE Eiffel 5.0 and ISE Eiffel 5.1:</H1>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



        <H2>What's new</H2>
        
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        
        <UL>
        
        <LI>.NET generation now includes:<UL>
        
        <li>Support for multiple inheritance</li>
        
        <li>Support for 
        generics.</li>
        
        <li>Partial implementation of generic conformance (same as what was 
        supported up to and including ISE Eiffel 4.2).</li>
        
        <li>Support for tuples and 
        agents.</li>
        
        <li>Will compile any existing Eiffel code that does not use any C 
        externals.</li>
        
        <li>Partial support for compiling Eiffel libraries using C 
        externals (e.g. WEL)
        </li>
        </UL>
        
        <p>And the following limitations:<UL>
        
        <li>Eiffel classes cannot inherit from non-Eiffel .NET classes (but they 
        can be clients).</li>
        <li>The compiler performances are rather poor now (both in terms of 
        memory usage and speed)</li>
        </UL>
        
        <p>Those limitation should disappear with 5.2 which will be our official 
        release that fully supports .NET<br>
&nbsp;<li>Support for INTEGER_64 constants. Now an manifest integer value that 
        is written in decimal or hexadecimal format that can't fit into an 
        INTEGER 32 will be automatically promoted to an INTEGER_64 constant 
        value.</li>
        <li>New feature access syntax for accessing constants, C/C++ externals 
        and IL static externals.

        </UL>
        
        <H2>Improvements</H2>
        
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <UL>
        
        <LI>Compiler that is about 20% faster than 5.0.</UL>
        
        
        <h2>Bug fixes</h2>
        
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed VAPE errors that were not previously reported. Now VAPE 
          errors are checked against arguments of a feature used in a 
          precondition and are also checked for a qualified call.</li>
          <li>Fixed a conformance bug that made a manifest array not to conform 
          to ANY.</li>
          <li>Fixed a generic conformance bug where an assignment attempt would 
          change the behavior of the execution.</li>
          <li>Fixed a wrongly reported error by the compiler in the following 
          case<p>In a system that has a generic class CLIENT with constraint `G 
          -&gt; SUPPLIER create make end', where the creation procedure of SUPPLIER 
          is exported to {CLIENT}. If another class has an attribute `x: CLIENT 
          [SUPPLIER]' the compiler reports a VTCG error, though it should accept 
          the classes.</li>
          <li>Fixed a crash when one of the following command line was used in a 
          directory with no existing project that contains a file named &quot;Ace&quot;:<br>
<pre>ec -flat      -all
ec -short     -all
ec -flatshort -all
ec -flat      -all_and_parents
ec -short     -all_and_parents
ec -flatshort -all_and_parents
</pre>
</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug in output display between standard output and error 
          output. Doing the following:<br>
          <pre>io.put_string (&quot;toto%N&quot;)
io.error.put_string (&quot;titi%N&quot;)          </pre>
          <p>you get the following output when simply launched from the command 
          line:<br>
          </p>
<pre>toto
titi</pre>
          <p>however if you do:<br>
          </p>
<pre>my_program &gt;&amp; RESULT</pre>
          <p>to redirect both standard and error outputs to RESULT you get in the 
          RESULT file this incorrect content:<br>
          </p>
          <pre>titi
toto</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Fixed a non reported VTEC or VTCG error when an invalid type used 
          as actual generic parameters in an explicit type in a creation 
          instruction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
