test_name multi-constraint-formal-heavy-renaming
test_description This test checks the correct handling and binding of creation features in the multi constraint case. It does this by declaring G of TEST1 should have a feature `make_a' available for creation. G of TEST2 has A descendant B as a constraint which renamed his creation feature. None the less the creation constraint of TEST1 should be met by G of B. C inherits twice from B and renames/redefines one feature and selects the other. The selected feature should be called no matter how the names are.
