test_name 	 manifest-array-of-strip
test_description A class has a routine which repeatedly creates a manifest array, each of whose elements is `strip ()'.  The class has one attribute, of type ARRAY [ANY].  Executing the system results in a run-time panic. Reducing the number of "strip ()" elements below 49 or turning off garbage collection allows the system to execute correctly for a huge number of iterations.
