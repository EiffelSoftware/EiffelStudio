	-- To reproduce error:
	-- Compile classes as is.  No problems.
	-- Then, removed the 3 lines below `inherit TEST1' in this
	--	class (redefine subclause).
	-- Rerun es3.  Compiler correctly complains about violation
	--	of VMFN.
	-- Now modify class TEST2 so that it is deferred and feature
	--	`z' in it is deferred.
	-- Hit return to retry compilation.  Compiler reports VMFN
	--	which is *not* being violated. The real problem is that 
	--	class TEST1 is violating VCCH since it has no deferred 
	--	header mark).
