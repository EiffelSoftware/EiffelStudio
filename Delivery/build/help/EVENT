Events
------

An event is a user-triggered action that can occur at run time. 
Typical events are `activate' (press a mouse key) and `text 
modify' (in an editable context where users can enter characters). 
Many events, such as `text modify', are meaningful for certain 
contexts only. Since each context has a type, it is not necesarry to 
consider all possible kinds of events, of which there may be several 
hundred in a sophisticated window system. A targeted Context tool 
gives you the list of possible events for that specific context.
