After initial melting of a root class whose creation procedure has an
empty body, a local of type LINKED_LIST [STRING] is added and the
routine body is modified to create the linked list and extend it with
one string.  The assertion level is `ensure'.  When the system is
recompiled and executed, system execution ends with a segmentation
fault in `go_to' of LINKED_LIST.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
