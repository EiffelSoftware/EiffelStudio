test_name 	 cloned-int-passed-to-double
test_description A routine passes `clone (k)' where `k' is of type INTEGER to a routine whose formal argument is of type DOUBLE.  If the system is melted, system execution ends with an "Illegal cast operation" run-time panic. Frozen code instead produces incorrect output.
