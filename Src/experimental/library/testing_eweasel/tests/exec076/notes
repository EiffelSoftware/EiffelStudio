A class repeatedly creates a manifest array with a single element of
type BIT 32.  Executing the system results in a segmentation fault or
run-time panic after a large number of iterations.  If garbage
collection is off or the BIT 32 array element is not a local entity,
the system executes correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
