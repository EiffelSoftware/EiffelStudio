A routine creates does a creation on an attribute of type `TEST1 [BIT
8]' where TEST1 [G] has a creation procedure with a single formal
argument of type G.  This creation procedure calls `out' on the formal
argument to display it.  The system compiles fine, but dies with a
precondition violation in `put' of BIT_REF.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
