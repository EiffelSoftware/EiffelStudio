		An ØMQ Context where ØMQ sockets live within.

		Each ØMQ socket  lives  within  a  specific  context.  Creating  and
		destroying context is a counterpart of library
		initialisation/deinitialisation as used elsewhere. Ability to create
		multiple  contexts saves  the  day  when an application happens to
		link (indirectly and involuntarily) with several instances of ØMQ.

		Implementation notes: the fact that ØMQ can work in a threaded
		enviroment is currently hidden by this Liberty wrappers

feature -- Socket: Request-Replay Pattern

			-- A socket of type ZMQ_REQ is used by a client to send requests to and receive
			-- replies from a service. This socket type allows only an alternating sequence
			-- of zmq_send(request) and subsequent zmq_recv(reply) calls. Each request sent
			-- is round-robined among all services, and each reply received is matched with
			-- the last issued request.

			-- When a ZMQ_REQ socket enters the mute state due to having reached the high
			-- water mark for all services, or if there are no services at all, then any
			-- zmq_send(3) operations on the socket shall block until the mute state ends
			-- or at least one service becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded.

			-- Summary of ZMQ_REQ characteristics
			-- Compatible peer sockets:    ZMQ_REP, ZMQ_ROUTER
			-- Direction:                  Bidirectional

			-- A socket of type ZMQ_REP is used by a service to receive requests from and send
			-- replies to a client. This socket type allows only an alternating sequence of

			-- is fair-queued from among all clients, and each reply sent is routed to the

			-- to the message before passing it to the application. Messages received
			-- are fair-queued from among all connected peers. When sending messages a

			-- to determine the identity of the peer the message shall be routed to. If
			-- the peer does not exist anymore the message shall be silently discarded
			-- by default, unless ZMQ_ROUTER_BEHAVIOR socket option is set to 1.

			-- When a ZMQ_ROUTER socket enters the mute state due to having reached the
			-- high water mark for all peers, then any messages sent to the socket shall
			-- be dropped until the mute state ends. Likewise, any messages routed to a
			-- peer for which the individual high water mark has been reached shall also
			-- be dropped.

			-- When a ZMQ_REQ socket is connected to a ZMQ_ROUTER socket, in addition to
			-- the identity of the originating peer each message received shall contain an
			-- empty delimiter message part. Hence, the entire structure of each received
			-- message as seen by the application becomes: one or more identity parts,
			-- delimiter part, one or more body parts. When sending replies to a ZMQ_REQ
			-- socket the application must include the delimiter part.
