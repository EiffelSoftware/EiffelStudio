		<H1>The Word Count Sample</H1>
        <P>
			This sample consists of a command line word counter. It provides
        quantitative information about the number of lines, words, characters
        and bytes in a given file.
		<H2>Compiling</H2>
		<P>
			To compile the example:
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>Launch EiffelBench.
			<LI>Select <B>Use existing Ace (control file)</B> and click <B>OK</B>.
			<LI>Browse to <I>Eiffel50\examples\base\word_count\</I>.
			<LI>Choose <I>Ace.mswin.ace</I> on Windows platforms or <I>Ace.unix.ace</I> on Unix platforms.
			<LI>Choose the directory where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the Ace file.
			<LI>Click <B>OK</B>.

		<H2>Running</H2>
		<P>
            To run the word count example, you must first open a console window.
            Here is the normal usage of the word count example:
		</P>
		<pre>Usage: WordCount [-a] [-o] [-f&lt;output-pathname>] input-pathname...
	-? Show this usage information
	-a Word usage sorted alphabetically
	-o Word usage sorted by occurrence and then alphabetically
	-f Send output to specified pathname instead of the console</pre>
		<P>
            Let us assume that you want to run the word count test over a file
            named WordCountTest, containing the following text:
		</P>
		<pre>first sentence
second sentence
third sentence</pre>
		<P>
            The plainest command line for that test is:
		</P>
		<pre>Wordcount.exe c:\WordCountTest.txt</pre>
		<P>
            The following result appear in the same console:
		</P>
		<PRE>Lines   Words   Chars   Bytes   Pathname
    3       6      43      47   c:\WordCountTest.txt
-----   -----   -----   -----   ---------------------
    3       6      43      47   Total in all files
</PRE>
		<p>
It is possible to have more precise information about the specified file
using&nbsp; the following options
		</p>
		<p>
1) Alphabetical sorting: -a
		</p>
		<p>
The command line for sorting words in alphabetical order is:
		</p>
		<PRE>Wordcount.exe -a c:\WordCountTest.txt</PRE>
		<p>
The displayed result is then the same as above with the following precision:
		</p>
		<PRE>Word usage sorted alphabetically (4 unique words)
1: first
1: second
3: sentence
1: third</PRE>
		<p>
2) Occurrence and alphabetical sorting: -o
		</p>
		<p>
The command line for sorting words according to their occurrences is:
		</p>
		<PRE>Wordcount.exe -o c:\WordCountTest.txt</PRE>
		<p>
The displayed result is then the same as above with the following precision:
		</p>
		<PRE>Word usage sorted alphabetically (4 unique words)
1: first
1: second
1: third
3: sentence</PRE>
		<p>
3) Sending results&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
Let us assume that you want to store the results of the word count test in a
file rather than displaying it in the main console, for e.g. WordCountResult.txt
file.You have then to use the -f option:
		</p>
		<PRE>Wordcount.exe -f c:\WordCountResult.txt c:\WordCountTest.txt</PRE>
		<P>
            No results is displayed in the main console, but they are all stored
            in the specified output file that is: WordCountResult.txt.
		</P>
