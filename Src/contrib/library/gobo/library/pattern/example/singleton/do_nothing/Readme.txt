This directory contains the source code for a program which does
nothing, but uses the Singleton Pattern to achieve that! If one
wants to implement the Singleton Pattern in one's program, one can
copy/paste the classes NULL_SINGLETON and SHARED_NULL_SINGLETON,
give them better names and add domain specific attributes and
routines to the singleton class as if it was a regular class.

To compile this example:

1. Use your favorite Eiffel compiler to compile the Eiffel system using
   the provided Ace, Xace or ECF file (e.g. <compiler>.ecf). Alternatively
   you can use 'geant' to launch the compilation:
   
       geant compile_<compiler>
       
   where <compiler> is either 'ise' or 'ge'.


2. Run the program using:

       do_nothing

   It will display the following messages:

       Used singleton
       Singleton created
       Used singleton again
