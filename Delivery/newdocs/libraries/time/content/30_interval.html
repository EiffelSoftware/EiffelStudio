<h1>Interval</h1>

<p>Class INTERVAL deals with intervals between two instances of the same class
which conform to
 
ABSOLUTE (<a href="/libraries/time/reference/date.html"><span class="eclass">DATE</span></a>, <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time.html"><span class="eclass">TIME</span></a>, <A HREF="/libraries/time/reference/date_time.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME</span></a>). The notions of interval is directly linked
with the notion of order.</p>
<p>
The start_bound must be before the end_bound.</p>

<h4>Creation</h4>

<p>The features make, set_start_bound and set_end_bound take clones of their
arguments, so that if these
 
arguments are changed, the interval previously created is not.</p>
<p>It would have been possible to create intervals with references to date or
time, but a modification of the dates
 
would have been effective in the interval so that only the invariant would
have been able to check if the
 
start_bound is still before the end_bound.</p>

<h4>Interval measurement</h4>

<p>The measure of intervals is made by duration: the result is an instance of
the class <a href="/libraries/time/reference/duration.html"><span class="eclass">DURATION</span></a>. However, as
 
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/duration.html"><span class="eclass">DURATION</span></a> is the common parent of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a>, <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> and
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME_DURATION</span></a>, it
 
does not have many features available. Some features in class <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time.html"><span class="eclass">TIME</span></a>, <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date.html"><span class="eclass">DATE</span></a>,
<A HREF="/libraries/time/reference/date_time.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME</span></a> return the same result and
 
are more efficient to use. <a href="/libraries/time/reference/duration.html"><span class="eclass">DURATION</span></a> has to be use as the last solution.</p>

<h4>Comparison</h4>

<p>It includes intersection, inclusion and a special comparison.</p>
<ul>
  <li>is_equal is present and compare values, not references.</li>
  <li>Feature intersects returns the mathematical result of the intersection of
two intervals.</li>
  <li>is_strict_included_by, strict_includes, is_included_by and includes are
connected to the same notion of inclusion.</li>
  <li>&lt;, + &gt; and &gt;= use a special rule to compare intervals. int1 &lt;
int2 is true if int1 starts and ends strictly before int2.
 
The other features use the same rule and is_equal if needed.</li>
  <li>overlaps looks like intersects but the argument has to be after the current
interval. is_overlapped is the opposite.</li>
  <li>meets and is_met are used to test if two intervals have a common bound.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Status Report</h4>

<p>The main part of the functions need an argument from the same generic type
and return a BOOLEAN value.</p>
<ul>
  <li>empty
 
tests if the bounds are equal.</li>
  <li>has, strict_before, strict_after, before and
after test the position of an element
 
relatively to the current interval.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Element change</h4>

<p>set_start_bound and set_end_bound are available to change the bounds.</p>

<h4>Operations</h4>

<p>Union and intersection are the mathematical functions. gather requires that
two intervals meet each other and then
 
yields the union.</p>
