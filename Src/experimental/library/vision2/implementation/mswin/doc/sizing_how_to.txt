Sizing operation on Windows:
============================

There is a class EV_POS_INFO which stores all the positioning information
about a EV_WIDGET:
- x: horizontal position within parent
- y: vertical position within parent
- width
- height
- minimum_width
- minimum_height
- is_user_min_width_set
- is_user_min_height_set

This information is always valid and always in sync with the information given
by WEL. A current limitation is that windows will always appear at position
(0,0). We will try to remove this latter on.

In EV_SIZEABLE_IMP you will find all features that update the `child_cell'
field of type EV_POS_INFO such as:
- ev_set_minimum_size
- ev_set_minimum_width
- ev_set_minimum_height
- ev_move
- ev_apply_new_size
- ev_move_and_resize
- ev_resize

You can access the size information through:
- minimum_width
- minimum_height
- width
- height
