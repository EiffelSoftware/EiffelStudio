<H1>Resource Bench Tour<HR ></H1><P>
<P>
1 - Launch the Resource Bench application. This small dialog box will appear for the initialization process: <P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./retriev.gif" ALT="retriev"   BORDER=></CENTER><P>
<P>
Then you get the main window of Resource Bench:<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./rb.gif" ALT="rb"   BORDER=></CENTER><P>
2 - Open a resource file (why not the example.rc file provided with this release of Resource Bench). Let the application parse the file. You will see a dialog box that informs you of the parsing's state. <P>
First, there is the preprocessing of the resource file:<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./prepro.gif" ALT="prepro"   BORDER=></CENTER><P>
<P>
Then you have the analysis phase:<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./analyz.gif" ALT="analyz"   BORDER=></CENTER><P>
<P>
3 - After these two steps you will see a hierarchical view of the resource file that show you what resource's type are included in the resource file (Below the result of the &quot;example.rc&quot; file).<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./collaps.gif" ALT="collaps"   BORDER=></CENTER><P>
<P>
You can expand the tree view to see associated resources for each resource's type.<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./expand.gif" ALT="expand"   BORDER=></CENTER><P>
<P>
At this point you are able to:<P>
<UL><LI>Select some properties for the Eiffel code generation<P>
<LI>Save a project file<P>
<LI>Generate Eiffel Code<P>
<LI>Regenerate the same resource file (the third point is very useful when you have a Resource Bench Project and do not have the original resource file that permits its creation).</UL><P>
<P>
4 - To save a project file, click on the save button of the toolbar or select the save item in the file menu. A standard save dialog box will appear in which you can specify the file name of your project. The file's extension for a Resource Bench project is &quot;*.prb&quot;<P>
<P>
5 - To generate Eiffel Code, select the &quot;Generate Eiffel Code...&quot; item in the Build menu, this dialog box will appear to ask you in which directory Resource Bench must save the Eiffel classes:<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./browse.gif" ALT="browse"   BORDER=></CENTER><P>
6 - To generate a resource file, select the &quot;Generate Resource file...&quot; item in the Build menu, a standard save dialog box will appear to save the file.<P>
