		<P>The Diagram Tool of EiffelStudio is your graphical interface to system structures. You can use it both to <I>examine</I> systems already built or under development, and to <I>build</I> these systems graphically. EiffelStudio supports complete seamlessness and reversibility between the Diagram Tool's graphical view and the text view of other EiffelStudio tools: whenever you make a change or addition with the graphical tool, EiffelStudio will update the text; and when you change the text, EiffelStudio will update the Diagram Tool's representation on the next compilation. </P>



		<P>Use the diagram tool to design new Eiffel systems, or create <A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/products/bon.html">BON</A> (Business Object Notation) diagrams of existing ones. BON is a simple, clear, self-explanatory notation that you will learn in a few minutes just by looking at some examples. The Diagram Tool provides you with lots of features to manage different views of an Eiffel system, or parts of it.
