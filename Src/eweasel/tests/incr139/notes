A class calls a routine and the routine calls its precursor.  After
initial compilation, system execution works correctly.  Then a rename
is removed, which causes the routine with the precursor call to have a
different precursor.  Recompilation works but execution output is
wrong.

Discovered in Release 4.2F.
