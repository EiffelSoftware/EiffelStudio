YOUR ROADMAP TO ISE EIFFEL DOCUMENTATION

=====================================================
WHAT YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY HAVE READ TO USE ISE EIFFEL:
=====================================================

- If you are a total Eiffel beginner:

	Read appendix D of [Environment], a general introduction to the concepts of
	Eiffel. Also available in this directory as an ASCII file: language.txt
	(but we do recommend the fully formatted version).

- Before using the environment:

	Read the Preface and chapters 1, Getting started, and 2, A Guided Tour,
	of [Environment].

	Read chapter 1 of [Library], Introduction to the Base libraries,
	to know what libraries are available.

=================================
TO PROCEED TO MORE ADVANCED USES:
=================================

Read the rest of [Environment].

Read the chapters of [Library] corresponding to the libraries that you may
want to use. To understand library principles, read chapters 2 and 3 of [Library].

Refer to [Reference] or to [Language] for specific language questions.

Read [Method] and [Language] to understand the approach in depth.

=========================================================
IF YOU ARE GOING TO DEVELOP GRAPHICAL (GUI) APPLICATIONS:
=========================================================

Read [EiffelBuild]. If you need to use EiffelVision directly, not just
through EiffelBuild, read [EiffelVision].

===============================================
IF YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF INSTALLING ISE EIFFEL:
===============================================

Read appendices B and C of [Environment].
