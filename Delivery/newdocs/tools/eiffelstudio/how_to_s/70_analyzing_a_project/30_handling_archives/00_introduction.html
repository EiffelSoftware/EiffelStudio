        <h1>Handling archives</h1>
        <p>The archive file for a system contains all the values of measures
        resulting from evaluating all metrics over the &quot;system&quot; scope
        when evaluation is possible. It also contains the definitions of non
        elementary metrics (the one user has <a href="/tools/eiffelstudio/how_to_s/70_analyzing_a_project/20_handling_new_metrics/10_defining_new_metrics/00_introduction.html">defined</a>
        or <a href="/tools/eiffelstudio/how_to_s/70_analyzing_a_project/20_handling_new_metrics/20_managing_new_metrics/40_importing_new_metrics.htm">imported</a>)
        in order to be sure of what is being measured.</p>
        <p>The archive files are entitled to achieve comparisons between
        systems. And then, user can compare systems to evaluate their own
        projects.</p>

        <p align="left">An archive can also be considered as a scope even if it
        is not a sub-element of the
        loaded system users are working on. Indeed, an archive contains
        measures, for another system than the current one,&nbsp; previously
        calculated and registered that could be retrieved. Consequently,
        evaluating a metric over an archive is nothing but retrieving the
        corresponding recorded measure.</p>
