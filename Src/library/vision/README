Before using the vision libraries you must compile
the C libraries in the Clib directory.
There is a Makefile in each subdirectory.

These make files have been set up for the Eiffel structure
but require you to set compiler option for the appropriate
platform.
You will also need to make sure that the parent directory
for X11/includes is defined or included in the make file.

Then place the archive produced in each subdirectory in the
directory $EIFFEL3/library/vision/spec/$PLATFORM/lib.

This will need to be done on for each platform you will
be running vision on.
