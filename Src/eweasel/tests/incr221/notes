Class A has a qualified call to one of its own features, where the
feature is exported only to B and its descendants.  This is valid
since class A is a descendant of B.  But when the inheritance clause
is removed, so that A is no longer a descendant of B, and the system
is recompiled, the VUEX violation is not detected.

Discovered in release 5.4.0610.
