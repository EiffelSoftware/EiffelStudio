test_name 	add-vuar-remove-finalize
test_description After initial compilation where the system is finalized, a creation procedure is changed to take an argument, introducing a VUAR error. When the system is re-finalized, the compiler detects the error.  Then the error is removed and compilation completes successfully, but the generated C code won't compile, due to conflicting declarations for the creation procedure's routine.
