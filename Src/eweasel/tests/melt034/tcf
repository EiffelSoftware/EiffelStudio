test_name 	who-gets-exp-local-exception
test_description A routine has a local of an expanded type, where the base class of this type has a creation procedure that raises an exception.  If the system is melted, the recipient of the exception is not the routine containing the declaration of the local but that routine's caller.  If the system is frozen, the routine containing the declaration of the expanded local is the recipient of the exception.
