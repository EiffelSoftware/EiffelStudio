A generic class has a reference to `<< x >>' where the type of
attribute `x' is the single formal generic parameter of the enclosing
class.  Another class has a generic derivation of the first class,
using a non-basic expanded type as the actual generic parameter.  The
system compiles fine, but when executed it dies with an exception
trace if it was melted.  Frozen code works fine.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
