        <P>The ISE Eiffel compiler offers now the possibility to generate a <B>dynamic 
		shared library</B> based on the system.</P>
		<P>Thanks to this dynamic library, it is possible to call Eiffel 
		features from a C program, by using the real names of the features.</P>
        <P>In other words, the user can generate a DLL <I>(*.dll)</I>  using
        features of the system on windows, and a shared library <I>(*.so)</I> on Unix.</P>
        <P>For that, the user has first to describe what he wants to export in
        his dynamic library. This is done via a definition file <I>(*.def)</I>,
        which specifies what features should be exported. A <A HREF="10_dynamic_library_builder.html">wizard</A> helps build
        the definition file, which makes this step very intuitive. The second
        step is to alter the HYPERLINK(Project settings, DLL definition file field)project settings to take this definition file into
        account. This done, the next compilation of the system will yield
        <A HREF="30_output_files.html">C files</A> that can be used to create the shared library.</P>
