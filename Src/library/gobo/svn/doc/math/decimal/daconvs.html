conversions between the abstract representation of numbers and string

one string-to-number conversion are defined.
<P>It is recommended that implementations also provide conversions to and from
binary floating-point or integer numbers, if appropriate (that is, if such
encodings are supported in the environment of the implementation). It is
suggested that such conversions be exact, if possible (that is, when converting
from binary to decimal), or alternatively give the same results as converting
using an appropriate string representation as an intermediate form. It is also
recommended that if a number is too large to be converted to a given binary
integer format then an exceptional or error condition be raised, rather than
losing high-order significant bits (decapitating).
<P>It is recommended that implementations also provide additional number
formatting routines (including some which are locale-dependent), and if
available should accept non-Arabic decimal digits in strings.
<P><B>Notes:</B>
<OL>
  <LI>The setting of <I>precision</I> may be used to convert a number from any
  precision to any other precision, using the <B>plus</B> operation. This meets
  the requirements of IEEE 854 §5.3.
  <LI>Integers are a proper subset of numbers, hence no conversion operation
  from an integer to a number is necessary. Conversion from a number to an
  integer is effected by using the <A
  href="daops.html#refrtoi"><B>round-to-integer</B>
  operation</A>. This meets the requirements of IEEE 854 §5.4 and §5.5. </LI></OL>

syntax</FONT></A></H3>Strings which are acceptable for conversion to the
abstract representation of numbers, or which might result from conversion from
the abstract representation to a string, are called <I>numeric strings</I>.
<P>A <I>numeric string</I> is a character string that describes either a
<I>finite number</I> or a <I>special value</I>.
<UL>
  <LI>If it describes a <I>finite number</I>, it includes one or more decimal
  digits, with an optional decimal point. The decimal point may be embedded in
  the digits, or may be prefixed or suffixed to them. The group of digits (and
  optional point) thus constructed may have an optional sign (‘<TT>+</TT>’ or
  ‘<TT>-</TT>’) which must come before any digits or decimal point. <BR>The
  string thus described may optionally be followed by an ‘<TT>E</TT>’
  (indicating an exponential part), an optional sign, and an integer following
  the sign that represents a power of ten that is to be applied. The
  ‘<TT>E</TT>’ may be in uppercase or lowercase.
  <LI>If it describes a <I>special value</I>, it is one of the case-independent
  names ‘<TT>Infinity</TT>’, ‘<TT>Inf</TT>’, ‘<TT>NaN</TT>’, or ‘<TT>sNaN</TT>’
  (where the first two represent <I>infinity</I> and may be preceded by an
  optional sign, as for finite numbers, and the second two represent <I>quiet
  NaN</I> and <I>signaling NaN</I> respectively). </LI></UL><I></I>No blanks or
other white space characters are permitted in a numeric string.

<H3><A name=reftostr><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>to-scientific-string –
conversion to numeric string</FONT></A></H3>This operation converts a number to
a string, using scientific notation if an exponent is needed. The operation is
not affected by the <I>context</I>.
<P>If the number is a <I>finite number</I> then:
<UL>
  <LI>The <I>coefficient</I> is first converted to a string in base ten using
  the characters 0 through 9 with no leading zeros (except if its value is zero,
  in which case a single 0 character is used). <BR>Next, the <I>adjusted
  exponent</I> is calculated; this is the <I>exponent</I>, plus the number of
  characters in the converted <I>coefficient</I>, less one. That is,
  <I>exponent</I><TT>+</TT>(<TT>clength</TT><TT>-</TT>1), where <TT>clength</TT>
  is the length of the <I>coefficient</I> in decimal digits. <BR>If the
  <I>exponent</I> is less than or equal to zero and the <I>adjusted exponent</I>
  is greater than or equal to <TT>-</TT>6, the number will be converted to a
  character form without using exponential notation. In this case, if the
  <I>exponent</I> is zero then no decimal point is added. Otherwise (the
  <I>exponent</I> will be negative), a decimal point will be inserted with the
  absolute value of the <I>exponent</I> specifying the number of characters to
  the right of the decimal point. ‘0’ characters are added to the left of the
  converted <I>coefficient</I> as necessary. If no character precedes the
  decimal point after this insertion then a conventional ‘0’ character is
  prefixed. <BR>Otherwise (that is, if the <I>exponent</I> is positive, or the
  <I>adjusted exponent</I> is less than <TT>-</TT>6), the number will be
  converted to a character form using exponential notation. In this case, if the
  converted <I>coefficient</I> has more than one digit a decimal point is
  inserted after the first digit. An exponent in character form is then suffixed
  to the converted <I>coefficient</I> (perhaps with inserted decimal point);
  this comprises the letter ‘<TT>E</TT>’ followed immediately by the <I>adjusted
  exponent</I> converted to a character form. The latter is in base ten, using
  the characters 0 through 9 with no leading zeros, always prefixed by a sign
  character (‘<TT>-</TT>’ if the calculated exponent is negative, ‘<TT>+</TT>’
  otherwise). <BR>Finally, the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign
  character<A name=backref.3><A
  href="daconvs.html#footnote.3"><FONT
  size=3><SUP>[3]</SUP></FONT></A></A>&nbsp; (‘<TT>-</TT>’) if <I>sign</I> is 1.

<UL>
  <LI>If the <I>special value</I> is <I>quiet NaN</I> then the resulting string

<OL>
  <LI>There is a one-to-one mapping between abstract representations and the
  result of this conversion. That is, every abstract representation has a unique
  <B>to-scientific-string</B> representation. Also, if that string
  representation is converted back to an abstract representation using <A
  href="daconvs.html#reftonum"><B>to-number</B></A>
  with sufficient precision, then the original abstract representation will be
  recovered. <BR>This one-to-one mapping guarantees that there is no hidden
  information in the internal representation of the numbers (‘what you see is
  exactly what you've got’).
  <LI>The values <I>quiet NaN</I> and <I>signaling NaN</I> are distinguished in
  string form in order to preserve the one-to-one mapping just described. The
  strings chosen are those currently under consideration by the IEEE 754 review
  committee.
  <LI>The digits required for an exponent may be more than the number of digits
  required for E<SUB>max</SUB> when a finite number is <A
  href="damodel.html#refsubnorm">subnormal</A>.

  <LI>IEEE 854 allows additional information to be suffixed to the string
  representation of special values. Any such suffixes are not permitted by this
  specification (again, to preserve the one-to-one mapping). It is suggested
  that if additional information is held in a concrete representation then a
  separate mechanism or operation is provided for accessing that information.

<H3><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>to-engineering-string – conversion to
numeric string</FONT></H3>This operation converts a number to a string, using
engineering notation if an exponent is needed.
<P>The conversion exactly follows the rules for conversion to scientific numeric
string except in the case of finite numbers where exponential notation is used.
In this case, the converted exponent is adjusted to be a multiple of three
(engineering notation) by positioning the decimal point with one, two, or three
characters preceding it (that is, the part before the decimal point will range
from <TT>1</TT> through <TT>999</TT>). This may require the addition of either
one or two trailing zeros.
<P>If after the adjustment the decimal point would not be followed by a digit
then it is not added. If the final exponent is zero then no indicator letter and
exponent is suffixed.

<H3><A name=reftonum><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>to-number – conversion
from numeric string</FONT></A></H3>This operation converts a string to a number,
as defined by its abstract representation. The string is expected to conform to
the <A href="daconvs.html#refnumsyn">numeric
string syntax</A>.
<P>Specifically, if the string represents a <I>finite number</I> then:
<UL>
  <LI>If it has a leading sign, then the <I>sign</I> in the resulting abstract
  representation is set appropriately (1 for ‘<TT>-</TT>’, 0 for ‘<TT>+</TT>’).
  Otherwise the <I>sign</I> is set to 0. <BR>The decimal-part and exponent-part
  (if any) are then extracted from the string and the exponent-part (following
  the indicator) is converted to form the integer <I>exponent</I> which will be
  negative if the exponent-part began with a ‘<TT>-</TT>’ sign. If there is no
  exponent-part, the <I>exponent</I> is set to 0. <BR>If the decimal-part
  included a decimal point the <I>exponent</I> is then reduced by the count of
  digits following the decimal point (which may be zero) and the decimal point
  is removed. The remaining string of digits has any leading zeros removed
  (except for the rightmost digit) and is then converted to form the
  <I>coefficient</I> which will be zero or positive. <BR>A numeric string to
  finite number conversion is always exact unless there is an underflow or
  overflow (see below) or the number of digits in the decimal-part of the string
  is greater than the <I>precision</I> in the context. In this latter case the
  coefficient will be rounded (shortened) to exactly <I>precision</I> digits,
  using the <I>rounding</I> algorithm, and the <I>exponent</I> is increased by
  the number of digits removed. <BR>If the value of the <A
  href="damodel.html#reffinite"><I>adjusted
  exponent</I></A> is less than E<SUB>min</SUB>, then the number is <A
  href="damodel.html#refsubnorm">subnormal</A>.
  In this case, the calculated coefficient and exponent form the result, unless
  the value of the <I>exponent</I></A> is less than E<SUB>tiny</SUB>, in which
  case the <I>exponent</I> will be set to <A
  href="damodel.html#refsubnorm">E<SUB>tiny</SUB></A>,
  and the coefficient will be rounded (possibly to zero) to match the adjustment
  of the exponent, with the <I>sign</I> remaining as set above. If this rounding
  gives an inexact result then the <A
  href="daexcep.html#refunderf">Underflow
  Exceptional condition</A> is raised. <BR>If (after any rounding of the
  coefficient) the value of the <I>adjusted exponent</I> is larger than <A
  href="damodel.html#reffinite">E<SUB>max</SUB></A>,
  then an exceptional condition (overflow) results. In this case, the result is
  as defined under the <A
  href="daexcep.html#refoverf">Overflow
  Exceptional condition</A>, and may be infinite. It will have the <I>sign</I>
  as set above. </LI></UL>

  <I>signaling NaN</I>, with <I>sign</I> 0.
  <LI>The strings ‘<TT>Infinity</TT>’ and ‘<TT>Inf</TT>’, optionally preceded by
  a sign character and independent of case, will be converted to
  <I>infinity</I>. In this case, the <I>sign</I> of the number is set to 1 if
