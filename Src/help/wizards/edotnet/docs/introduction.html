			The new .NET Wizard aims at helping you to build your first Eiffel Sharp applications. In a very simple way, it will ask for your project settings and then automatically generate the Ace file (the control file) and the project root class (the entry point of the application) for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			The wizard also gives you access to <a href = "../assembly_manager/index.html">ISE Assembly Manager</a> to enable you to import other external assemblies (if you need an assembly that is not imported yet to build your application).
		</p>

			<b>Happy Eiffel Sharp developing with the new .NET Wizard !</b>
