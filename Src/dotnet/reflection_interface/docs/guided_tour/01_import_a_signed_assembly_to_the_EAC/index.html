			<h1>Guided Tour of ISE Assembly Manager <br>
			First step: Importing an assembly to the Eiffel assembly cache</h1>
		</center>
		<br>
		<p>
			ISE Assembly Manager mainly aims at providing you with the ability to edit assembly types to have user-friendlier names than the automatically generated ones. Therefore some useful assemblies will already be imported when you first use the product. <br>Nevertheless, you will certainly want to import other assemblies from the Global Assembly Cache or simply import some assemblies you generated. This is the reason why our guided tour begins by a step by step description on how to import an assembly to the Eiffel assembly cache.
