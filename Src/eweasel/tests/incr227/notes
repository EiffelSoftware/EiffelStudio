A system is compiled with an Ace file which specifies a nonexistent
library via `object: "-lweasel"'.  Then the `object' clause is removed
completely from the Ace and system is melted.  When the previously
generated C code is compiled, it won't link because the (nonexistent)
library is still referenced.

Discovered in release 5.4.0709.
