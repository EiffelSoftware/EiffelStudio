		<P>EiffelStudio editor now offers the possibility to complete feature calls automatically. This means that
		when the user types &quot;<i>an_identifier.an_incomplete_feature_name</i>&quot; and then triggers the
        auto-complete, the
		editor will propose a list of possible feature names correct in this situation.<BR>To be more
		precise, a window will pop up and display the list of features that can be called on
		<i>an_identifier</i> and that match <i>an_incomplete_feature_name</i>. The user can accept the suggested name, choose another name (in the list or not), or simply
		cancel the auto-complete.
		</P>
        <p align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/editor_auto_completion_window.png"></P>
		<P>To trigger the autocomplete, press the key combination &quot;Ctrl+Space&quot; or click on
		<B>Complete word</B> in the <B>Advanced</B> sub-menu of the <B><a href="../80_edit_menu_commands.html">Edit</a></B> <a href="../80_edit_menu_commands.html">
        menu</a>. If automatic completion is
		possible, there are two cases : if only one name matches, this name will
        be inserted in the editor. If there are no matching names or several ones a window will
        appear. This window will contain a text field and a list. The text field will be
		filled with the beginning of the feature name that was entered. The first item
       in the list, if	any, will be selected.<BR>
		To complete your code with the selected item, press &quot;Enter&quot; or &quot;Ctrl+Space&quot;.<BR>
		To choose another item, use keyboard Up and Down arrows or the mouse. You can also modify the
		content of the text field. The list will be updated automatically. To validate your choice,
		press &quot;Enter&quot; or &quot;Ctrl+Space&quot;. If there is no selected item, the content of the text field
		will be inserted.<BR>
		To cancel the auto-complete, press &quot;Esc&quot; at any time.

		<B>Tips</B>:
		<UL>
			<LI>If the selected feature is a query, you can call the
              auto-complete again right after the
			previous completion. There is no need to type a dot.
			<LI>You can call the auto-complete without an identifier. The
              auto-complete window will then
			show the features of the current class.
			<LI>The keyboard shortcut for automatic completion can be changed in the
              <a href="../../85_preferences/20_preferences_reference/20_tools/30_editor/20_keyboard_shortcuts_preferences.html"> editor
              preferences</a>.
			<LI>Typing a non-alphanumeric character in the completion window
              automatically closes it. You can therefore type '.', ' ' or '(' to
              close the completion window and start typing the next token
              straight away.

		<B>Notes</B>:
		<UL>
			<LI>Only identifiers that were already defined when the class was compiled for the last time can be
              completed, except for local entity names that can always be completed.
			<LI>Only compiled features will appear in the auto-complete window.
			<LI>By default, features from class ANY will be ignored by the auto-complete window. This can be
			changed in the <a href="../../85_preferences/20_preferences_reference/20_tools/30_editor/10_general_editor_preferences.html"> editor
              preferences</a>.
