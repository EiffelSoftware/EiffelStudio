						EiffelVision 2 is a platform independent Graphical User Interface
						(GUI) library that allows easy, simultaneous development of Windowed
						applications for both Windows &amp; Unix based platforms.&nbsp; Heavily
						relying on ISE's premier EiffelBase library, EiffelVision 2 has been
						designed primarily with ease of use in mind.&nbsp; By reusing EiffelBase
						structures, existing, as well as new Eiffel users will find EiffelVision
						to be surprising intuitive and easy to use.&nbsp; In no time, users
						will be producing good-looking Windowed application skeletons, of which
						will run on a multitude of platforms with no manipulation of code.
					</P>
						The EiffelVision 2 library includes the following interface clusters:
						<UL>
							<LI>
								A <A href="00_kernel/index.html"> Kernel</A> cluster that includes classes that are key to a
								Vision2 application.&nbsp; The main class being <A href="../reference/interface/kernel/ev_application_chart.html"> EV_APPLICATION</A>
								which is the main entry point of all Vision2 applications.
							</LI>
							<LI>
								A <A href="10_widgets/index.html"> Widgets</A> cluster containing classes that used to
								create Vision2 widgets.&nbsp; Widgets are the visible objects
								that the user sees and interacts with on the desktop, examples
								of widgets are windows, buttons and labels.
							</LI>
							<LI>
								An <A href="20_items/index.html"> Items</A> cluster includes the classes needed to create
								items, items can be thought of as widgets that are contained
								within only a certain type of widget, such as an <A href="../reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_list_chart.html"> EV_LIST</A> that
								may only contain objects of type <A href="../reference/interface/items/ev_list_item_chart.html">EV_LIST_ITEM</A>.&nbsp; Items provide an
								abstract way of dealing with an item widget's internal data
								structures and provide in many cases the same functionality
								that a widget does.
							</LI>
							<LI>
								An <A href="30_events/index.html"> Events</A> cluster containing classes that allow for user initiated
								events, such as the clicking of a button to be dealt with via the
								use of a linked list of agents (<A href="../reference/interface/events/ev_action_sequence_chart.html">EV_ACTION_SEQUENCE</A>).&nbsp;
								Agents can be thought of as an object that encapsulates a
								certain procedure.&nbsp; When a user clicks a button on the
								screen, the corresponding <A href="../reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_button_chart.html"> EV_BUTTON</A> object has its associating
								<A href="../reference/interface/events/ev_widget_action_sequences.html#f_pointer_button_press_actions"><SPAN CLASS=efeature>pointer_button_press_actions</SPAN></A> fired and this in turn,
								fires all of the agents held within, thus calling all of the
								procedures represented by the agents.&nbsp; Every widget and
								item has a certain number of <A href="../../base/reference/event/action_sequence_chart.html">ACTION_SEQUENCE</A>
								objects that are linked
								with a certain type of event.
							</LI>
							<LI>
								A <A href="40_properties/index.html"> Properties</A> cluster contains classes that allow for the
								customization of Vision 2 widgets and items.&nbsp; Classes
								such as <A href="../reference/interface/properties/ev_colorizable_chart.html">EV_COLORIZABLE</A>
								and <A href="../reference/interface/properties/ev_fontable_chart.html">EV_FONTABLE</A>
								contain routines that allow for color and fonts to be altered
								for a widget or item respectively.
							</LI>
							<LI>
								A <A href="50_support/index.html"> Support</A> cluster includes classes that provide more
								professional touches to an application, whether these are
								keyboard shortcuts (<A href="../reference/interface/support/ev_accelerator_list_chart.html">EV_ACCELERATOR_LIST</A>)
								or graphical output (<A href="../reference/interface/support/ev_graphical_format_chart.html">EV_GRAPHICAL_FORMAT</A>)
								for drawable widgets such as <A href="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_pixmap_chart.html">EV_PIXMAP</A>.
							</LI>
							<LI>
								A <A href="60_figures/index.html"> Figures</A> cluster that allows for the projection of
								two-dimensional shapes (figures) on to an <A href="../reference/interface/properties/ev_drawable_chart.html">EV_DRAWABLE</A>
								or printer via the use of an <A href="../reference/interface/figures/ev_projector_chart.html">EV_PROJECTOR</A>.
							</LI>
