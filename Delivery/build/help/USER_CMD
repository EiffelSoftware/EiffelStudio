User-defined commands
---------------------

A command is an object describing the execution of some
operation by the system.

Commands provide the basic mechanism for achieving EiffelBuild's
goal of covering system semantics as well as the interface.

A command object is an instance of a command class, a descendant
of the EiffelVision class COMMAND; every such effective descendant
must provide a procedure `execute' which describes the intended effect
of the command.

This procedure, which can include arbitrary instructions and
calls to other features, provides the link with the rest of
the system. A command may also inherit from UNDOABLE (an heir 
of COMMAND), in which case it will also provide a feature
`undo', supporting a convenient undo-redo mechanism.

EiffelBuild has a number of predefined commands, and also allows
the addition of user-defined commands, such as the one that you
have selected.
