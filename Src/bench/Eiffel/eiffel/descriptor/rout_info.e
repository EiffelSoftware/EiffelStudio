-- Information about a routine.
-- A routine represents a feature with all its versions in descendant classes, 
-- obtained through renaming or adaptation. A new routine is introduced either 
-- when there are no precursors or trough duplication (in the case of repeated 
-- inheritance). A routine has an origin, which is the class in which it was 
-- introduced, and an offset which is an unique identification number of the 
-- routine in the origin class.
-- Currently the offset mechanism is only used in workbench mode since it is 
-- more incremental but yields less efficient feature call mechanism.
