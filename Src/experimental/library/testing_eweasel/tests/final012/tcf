test_name 	finalize-cast-func-result
test_description An external routine has a signature specified (e.g., "C (double): long") to cause casting of a result before it is passed back to the Eiffel side.  The external routine is redefined in a descendant.  In a call to the routine which is statically bound, the cast is not applied to the result of the function call in the generated C code if the system is finalized.  This results in wrong results when the system is executed.  A frozen system works correctly.
