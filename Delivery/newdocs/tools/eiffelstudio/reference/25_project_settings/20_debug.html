<h1>Debug Tab</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is what the debug tab look like when you haven't compiled your system
you just created.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Execution parameter</h2>
<p>You can specify the location from where your program will run. By default the
location is `your_project_path/EIFGEN/W_code'. This is useful when your
application relies on the use of resource files located at a precise location.</p>
<p>You can also specify one or more command line arguments. To add one, simply
type your command line arguments in the combo box and press enter. To remove
one, select it from the combo box and then click on the red cross. To select
one, simply choose it from the combo box, and when you will click on Apply or Ok
they will be automatically taken into account, no need to recompile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous options</h2>
<ul>
  <li>line number generation when selected will generate in either .NET
    generation or C generation some extra information that will enable a .NET
    debugger or a C debugger to step through the Eiffel code rather than MSIL
    code or C code.</li>
  <li>call tracing when selected will in C generation mode only display on the
    console all the features that are called during the system execution.</li>
  <li>profiling when selected will in C generation mode turn on the Eiffel
    profiler during execution. The results can be seen at the end of the
    execution in <a href="../70_wizards_and_dialogs/10_profiler_wizard/00_introduction.html">the
    profiler window</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Debug options</h2>
<p>By default all debug clauses are turned off.</p>

<p>The first step to enable them is to select the `Enable debug' check box. Then
select the one you want to enable/disable and do a right click on it and a
contextual menu will appear in which you can chose to enable/disable the debug
clause.</p>

<p>Before you compile for the first time your project with an Ace file that has
been automatically created, you
won't see any debug clauses. They will automatically be added by the compiler at
the end of your first compilation. When this is done, you can
enable/disable each of them.</p>
