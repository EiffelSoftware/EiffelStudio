A class has an attribute of an expanded type, which has 100 expanded
attributes, where the class for each attribute has 100 attributes of
type DOUBLE. The system compiles fine when melted or frozen, but dies
with a panic when `full_collect' is called.  Finalized code works
correctly.

Discovered in Release 5.4.0515.
