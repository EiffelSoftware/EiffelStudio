A class with a formal generic parameter G constrained by ARRAY [STRING] 
declares an attribute of type G.  An assignment of one of the elements
of the attribute to the attribute itself violates the Assignment Rule,
but the compiler does not detect the VJAR violation.  Execution of the
resulting system ends with a bus error.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.05.17.
