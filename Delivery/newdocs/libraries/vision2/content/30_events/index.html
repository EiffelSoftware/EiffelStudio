		<H1>Events Overview</H1>
        <P>
	This cluster contains classes for event handling within Vision2.&nbsp; To
    view the classes contained in the the events cluster click <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/events/index.html">here</A>. </P>
	<H2>What is an event?</H2>
	<P>
		An event is considered to be an external action that occurs during a program's execution. Correctly dealing with events is an important part of developing
		a Vision2 application. For example, if a user clicks on a button, you
        will want to respond to this event by calling a routine that deals with
        the request.&nbsp; Vision2 contains action sequences for all kinds of
        widget events, to view the kind of events available to every widget,
        click <a href="../../reference/interface/events/ev_widget_action_sequences_chart.html">here</a>.
	</p>
	<H2>How do I connect to an event?</H2>
        <p>Every widget and item has an action sequence associated with it that
        relates to some kind of event, for example an EV_BUTTON has a
        select_actions action sequence.&nbsp; This gets fired when the user
        clicks/selects the button.&nbsp; To have a procedure called on this
        event, you need to create an agent based on this procedure, and then add
        this to the action sequence (via extend).&nbsp; For a more detailed description of agents and their uses click <a href="/general/guided_tour/language/invitation-09.html">here</a>.
	
	</p>
	
        <p>&nbsp;
	
	</p>
	
        <P>An example of adding an agent to an action_sequence is as follows.
	
	</p>
	
        <p>&nbsp;
	
	</p>
	
        <p Class ="code"><SPAN Class="eclass">button</SPAN>.<SPAN Class="efeature">select_actions.extend</SPAN> (<SPAN Class="ekeyword">agent</SPAN> <SPAN Class = "efeature">print </SPAN>(<SPAN Class="estring">&quot;Button Clicked!%N&quot;</SPAN>))
	
	</p>
	
        <p>&nbsp;
	
	</p>
	
        <p>
 All Vision2 action sequences inherit <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/events/ev_action_sequence_chart.html">EV_ACTION_SEQUENCE</A> and
		when it is called, all of the agents held within are fired, thus calling all of the procedures represented by the agents. The signature of any agent that you place in an action sequence must conform to those of the action sequences actual generic parameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
	</p>
	
        <p>
        When you want an agent to be called from a certain action sequence and
        the signatures do not match, you may use <a href="../../reference/interface/events/ev_action_sequence.html#f_force_extend">force_extend</a>, this will call
        your agent but has no guarantees on the arguments passed to your
 procedure.
