<h2>General description</h2>
<p>Basically, we will promote classes that are multiply-inherited into .NET
interfaces. To give an example if in Eiffel you have:</p>
<pre>class
	C
inherit
	A
	B
end</pre>
<p>then in .NET you might have the following set of classes and interfaces:</p>
<pre>class A implements IA
class B implements IB
class C implements IA and IB

interface IA
interface IB</pre>
<p>This is one way of seeing it, but we could generate it in many different
ways. It is important that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Eiffel for .NET compiler through the Assembly
Manager can re-read the metadata
to go back to the original form</li>
  <li>other languages can understand the
metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the last point, we decided that we would indeed generate the
following set of classes and interfaces:</p>
<pre>class A_IMP implements A
class B_IMP implements B
class C_IMP implements A and B

interface B
interface C</pre>

<p>So if in Eiffel you have the following piece of code:</p>

<pre>b: B
c: C

create c
b := c</pre>

<p>It will translate in C# as:</p>

<pre>B b;
C c;

/* Method 1 */
c = new C_IMP();
b = c;

/* Method 2 */
c = EiffelFactory.new_C();
b = c;</pre>

<p class="note"><b>Note:<br>
</b>Creation is performed in two different ways. One through the use of a .NET
constructor, and the second one through a factory call. Both will be implemented
in case there is no way to use the .NET constructor mechanism, but we will try
to stick as much as possible on the use of .NET constructor.</p>

A real example</h2>

<p>
Let's suppose we have the following example. In which we do most of what can be
seen in an Eiffel library that uses multiple inheritance.
<pre>class
	A
feature
	f is do ... end
	g (x: X) is do ... end
end</pre>
<pre>class B
inherit
	A
		rename f as h
		redefine g
		end
feature
	g (y: Y) is do ... end
end</pre>
<pre>class C
inherit
	A
end</pre>
<pre>class
	D
inherit
	B
		select
			g
		end
	C
		rename
			g as C_g
		select
			f
		end
end</pre>
<pre>deferred class F
feature
	f is do ... end
end</pre>
<pre>class E
inherit
	C
		undefine f end
	F
end</pre>
<pre>class X
end</pre>
<pre>class Y
inherit X
end</pre>
<p>This is better described by the following BON diagram:<p align="center">

have a look at what we should generate as an inheritance hierarchy:<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="diamond_inheritance_on_dotnet-method2.png" width="661" height="476">
<p>The hierarchy is much simpler than the first method.</p>
<pre>.interface A {
	f ();
	g (X x);
}

.class A_IMP: A {
	f () { call s_f (Current); };
	g (X x) { call s_g (Current, x); };

	static s_f (A a) { ... };
	static s_g (A a, X x) { ... };
}</pre>

<pre>.interface B: A {
	h ();
	g (Y y);
}

.class B_IMP: B {
	h {} {
		.override A::f
		call s_h (Current);
	};

	g (Y y) { call s_g (Current, y); };

	private __g (X x) {
		.override A::g
		call s_g ((Y) x))
	}

	static s_h (B b) { call A_IMP::s_f (b); }
	static s_g (B b, Y y) { ... }
}</pre>

<pre>.interface C: A

.class C_IMP: C {
	f () { call s_f (Current); };
	g (X x) { call s_g (Current, x); };

	static s_f (C a) { call A_IMP::s_f (Current); };
	static s_g (C a, X x) { call A_IMP::s_g (Current, x); };
}</pre>

<pre>.interface D: B, C {
	C_g (X x);
}

.class D_IMP: D {
	f() {};		
	C_g (X x) {};
}</pre>

<pre>.interface F {
	f();
}

.class F_IMP: F {
	f() { call s_f (Current); };

	static s_f (F f) { ... };
}</pre>

<pre>.interface E: C, F

.class E_IMP: E {
	f() {
		.override C::f
		call s_f (Current);
	};
	g(X x) { call s_g (Current, x); };

	static s_f (E e) { call F_IMP::s_f (e); };
	static s_g (E e, X x) { call C_IMP::s_g (e, x); };
