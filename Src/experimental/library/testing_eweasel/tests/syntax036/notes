An assignment whose source is an address expression `$x' (which is of
type pointer) and whose target is of type POINTER should be accepted,
but the compiler reports a syntax error.  Replacing `$x' with `ptr
($x)', where `ptr' just returns its argument, causes the compiler to
accept the class.

Discovered in Release 3.3.3.
