feature -- Style

	Cbs_autohscroll: INTEGER is 64
			-- Automatically scrolls the text in an edit control to the right
			-- when the user types a character at the end of the line. If
			-- this style is not set, only text that fits within the
			-- rectangular boundary is allowed. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_AUTOHSCROLL

	Cbs_simple: INTEGER is 1
			-- Displays the list box at all times. The current selection in
			-- the list box is displayed in the edit control. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_SIMPLE

	Cbs_dropdown: INTEGER is 2
			-- Similar to CBS_SIMPLE, except that the list box is not
			-- displayed unless the user selects an icon next to the edit
			-- control. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_DROPDOWN

	Cbs_dropdownlist: INTEGER is 3
			-- Similar to CBS_DROPDOWN, except that the edit control is
			-- replaced by a static text item that displays the current
			-- selection in the list box. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_DROPDOWNLIST

	Cbs_ownerdrawfixed: INTEGER is 16
			-- Specifies that the owner of the list box is responsible for
			-- drawing its contents and that the items in the list box are
			-- all the same height. The owner window receives a
			-- WM_MEASUREITEM message when the combo box is created and a
			-- WM_DRAWITEM message when a visual aspect of the combo box has
			-- changed. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED

	Cbs_ownerdrawvariable: INTEGER is 32
			-- Specifies that the owner of the list box is responsible for
			-- drawing its contents and that the items in the list box are
			-- variable in height. The owner window receives a WM_MEASUREITEM
			-- message for each item in the combo box when you create the
			-- combo box and a WM_DRAWITEM message when a visual aspect of
			-- the combo box has changed. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE

	Cbs_oemconvert: INTEGER is 128
			-- Converts text entered in the combo box edit control from the
			-- Windows character set to the OEM character set and then back
			-- to the Windows set. This ensures proper character conversion
			-- when the application calls the CharToOem function to convert a
			-- Windows string in the combo box to OEM characters. This style
			-- is most useful for combo boxes that contain file names and
			-- applies only to combo boxes created with the CBS_SIMPLE or
			-- CBS_DROPDOWN style. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_OEMCONVERT

	Cbs_sort: INTEGER is 256
			-- Automatically sorts strings added to the list box. 
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_SORT

	Cbs_hasstrings: INTEGER is 512
			-- Specifies that an owner-drawn combo box contains items
			-- consisting of strings. The combo box maintains the memory and
			-- address for the strings so the application can use the
			-- CB_GETLBTEXT message to retrieve the text for a particular
			-- item. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_HASSTRINGS

	Cbs_disablenoscroll: INTEGER is 2048
			-- Shows a disabled vertical scroll bar in the list box when the
			-- box does not contain enough items to scroll. Without this
			-- style, the scroll bar is hidden when the list box does not
			-- contain enough items. 
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_DISABLENOSCROLL

	Cbs_lowercase: INTEGER is 16384
			-- Converts to lowercase all text in both the selection field 
			-- and the list.

			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_LOWERCASE

	Cbs_nointegralheight: INTEGER is 1024
			-- Specifies that the size of the combo box is exactly the size
			-- specified by the application when it created the combo box.
			-- Normally, the system sizes a combo box so that it does not
			-- display partial items. 
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as CBS_NOINTEGRALHEIGHT

			-- Converts to uppercase all text in both the selection field and
			-- the list.
