		<paragraph>The call stack is the list of features that have been entered and not exited since the program started. It is a stack since before a feature exits, all the features it calls must exit too. The last entered feature is the top of the stack whereas the program root feature is its bottom.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>There is one level in the call stack, apart from the top, that has a special status and corresponds to a special call stack element. It is the level to which all debugging tools refer. It is user-definable, so that it is possible to move along the call stack and have information about any level, by setting each level as the current call stack level in its turn.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>To keep trace of a call stack (for example in order to indicate to other people where a problem occurred), it is possible to
