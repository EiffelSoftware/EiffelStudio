A routine redefines an inherited routine that returns an expanded type
or a BIT type and replaces it with an attribute.  It also includes
references to the attribute.  The code compiles fine, but dies with a
segmentation fault or "feature applied to void reference" if it was
frozen.  Melted code works fine.  This appears to be a code generation bug.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
