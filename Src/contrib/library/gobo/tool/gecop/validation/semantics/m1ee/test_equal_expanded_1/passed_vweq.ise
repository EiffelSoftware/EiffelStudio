Warning code: VWEQ

Type warning: incompatible Equality expression. 
Possible to do: if you did not intend to have a incompatible Equality
  expression, make sure that one of the operand types is compatible to the
  other, otherwise, even if statically it should be False, it might
  be True at runtime when both operands are attached to types which are
  compatible.
