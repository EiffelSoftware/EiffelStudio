<h1>Preference window overview</h1>
The preferences dialog window is divided into two parts (plus a button
bar at the bottom).
<p align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/dialogs_and_wizards/preferences_dialog.png"></P>
<p>The left part is used to display a tree that shows preference categories.
A description of the contents of this tree, i.e. the different categories
of preferences and preferences themselves, is available <a href="./20_preferences_reference/index.html">here</a>.<p>The right part shows the preferences attached to the currently
selected tree node. They appear in a table that has two columns. The first
one contains the description of the preference, the second one contains
its value. To modify this value, select the preference by clicking on it. A
floating widget appears on top of the preference value to let you change it.
<p>The floating widget depends on the type of the preference that is modified.
There are four kinds of preferences:
<ul>
<li>
Boolean preferences : their possible values are "True" and "False". A combo box
will allow you to choose between both.</li>

<li>
Color preferences : Their value is represented by three integers, which
are the RGB code of the color. You do not have to use RGB codes though.
When you select such a preference, the current color and two buttons are
displayed. If you press the first button, a color
selection window will appear. For some background colors, you have the possibility
to click the "Auto" button. EiffelStudio will then set the current color
to the default background color.</li>

<li>
Font preferences : A font selection window will appear as you press the
button with label "change".</li>

<li>
Other preferences : They will be modified by typing their value directly.</li>
</ul>
If there is no message stating you need to restart EiffelStudio, changes will be taken
into account immediately.

<p CLASS="Tip"><b>Tip</b>: Sub-categories and their contents are
not displayed in the right area. To see the preferences that belong
to a sub-category, you have to select it in the left part of the window.

<p CLASS="warning"><b>Caution</b>: You can restore preferences default
values by clicking on the "Restore Default" button. ALL preferences will
be reset.
