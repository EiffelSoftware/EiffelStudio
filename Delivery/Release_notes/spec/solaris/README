RELEASE NOTE FOR SOLARIS 2.4 VERSION

This note does not apply to any version other than Solaris
2.4. In particular it does not apply to the SunOS version.

1) C compiler
-------------

You can not use the C compiler shipped with non development system since it
is only used to rebuild the kernel.

If you have installed the SPROcc package, the default location for the C
compiler is /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc.


2) Displaying on another Sun machine
------------------------------------

When running the Solaris 2.4 version of EiffelBench on a computer,
do not display on another Sun computer running Open Windows.
This may crash the X server on that other computer.

This bug occurs somewhat randomly (usually only in the second
consecutive execution of EiffelBench) and does not arise
for any platform other than Solaris 2.4.  We have not yet
been able to determine what causes it.

The following do NOT cause any problem:

	- Running on a Solaris computer and displaying on the
	same computer (the most common case).

	- Running on a Solaris computer and displaying on a
	non-Sun computer.

	- Executing other tools of the environment, in particular
	EiffelBuild.
