		<h1>The Eiffel Assembly Cache</h1>
		<p>
			The Eiffel Assembly Cache is a repository where the compiler saves the required information to be able to <b>associate Eiffel names with .NET names</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
            It <b>keeps tracks of the changes</b> you make when editing types via the <a href = "../30_type_view/index.html">Type
            View</a>:
			the Eiffel Assembly Cache is updated (i.e. old names replaced by new ones)
            after the Assembly Manager has checked that the changes are
            consistent.
		</p>
		<p>
            The Assembly Manager is notified whenever the Eiffel Assembly Cache is modified, so that it always <b>displays the relevant names</b>.
		</p>
		<p class = "note">
			<b>Note:</b> The Eiffel Assembly Cache is <b>self-sufficient</b>: When you launch the Eiffel code generation from
            the Assembly Manager (via the <a href = "../40_eiffel_generation_dialog/index.html">Eiffel
            Generation Dialog</a>), the generator finds all the information it
            needs in the Eiffel Assembly Cache. There is no need to explore the assembly metadata anymore, which results in
            a noteworthy gain of time.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Eiffel Assembly Cache is located in <i>$ISE_EIFFEL\dotnet\assemblies</i>, where
            <i> $ISE_EIFFEL</i> is the path to your Eiffel delivery.
			If you explore it, you will see that information is saved in separate folders, each folder corresponding to one imported assembly.
