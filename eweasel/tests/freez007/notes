A routine has a local of an expanded type.  The body of the routine
raises an exception which is retried by the rescue clause.  If the
system is frozen, the expanded local is incorrectly initialized again
when the retry instruction is executed.  Melted code works correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
