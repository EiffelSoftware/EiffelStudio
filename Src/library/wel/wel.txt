Windows Eiffel Library (WEL)
ISE, Inc.
----------------------------

What is WEL?
------------

The new Windows Eiffel Library (WEL), which has been designed to 
make Windows programming easier, more reliable, more convenient, 
and more powerful.

The most obvious definition of WEL is that it is an encapsulation of 
Windows primitives, making it possible for users of Graphical Eiffel 
for Windows to have direct access to the Windows graphical API. 

But this is only part of the truth. WEL provides considerable benefits 
of its own: the ability to work in a much simpler, move convenient and 
safer way than if you were using the Windows primitives directly, for
example from C. 

This advantage comes from the abstraction facilities of Eiffel, which 
make it possible to encapsulate many low-level details so that 
developers can concentrate on the functionality, not implementation 
requirements. 

So even for specific and OS-dependent tasks such as using a particular 
graphical API, the benefits of the Eiffel method and of reusable Eiffel 
components will show up quickly.


What's new?
-----------

o New `Win32' cluster
  WEL provides a new Win32-specific cluster which includes classes that work
  only under Windows 95/NT. This cluster needs a recent common controls header
  file (commctrl.h) provided with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.1 and Borland C++ 4.52.
  See example `Comctrls'.

o New command model
  WEL provides a new command model (EiffelVision-like).
  See example `Commands'.

o New H2E utility
  The interface has been improved, it's easier than ever to use it.

o New WEL tutorial
  A tutorial to learn WEL step by step.
  See directory $EIFFEL3\examples\wel\tutorial.
  This tutorial is also available on our WEB site at:
  http://www.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/wel/tutorial/index.html

o New WEL reference manual
  This manual describes all the WEL classes (description, interface, example).

o New WEL Examples
  `Timer', `Fontenum', `Stddlgs', `Comctrls', `Magnify', `Richedit', `Commands'.


What WEL does not include yet?
------------------------------

o Some Windows 95 common controls: Animation Controls,
  Drag List Boxes, Header Controls, Hot-Key Controls, Image Lists,
  List View Controls, Property Sheets, Tab Controls, Tree View Controls,
  Up-Down Controls.

o Find and replace common dialog box.


Resource file
-------------

The resource file name must have the same name as the system name specified in
the Ace file.

When you change the resource file (.RC), you have to freeze the system in
order to recompile the resource file and see the effect. A quicker way consists
of running the make utility (`make' for Borland or `nmake' for Microsoft) in
.\EIFGEN\W_CODE. But first, make sure to delete the .RES file.

If you have created a resource file using Microsoft Developer Studio, you will
probably need to change the file $EIFFEL3\bench\spec\w32msc\es3sh\config.eif.
Retrieve the following portion of text:

-------------
$appl.res: $appl.rc working.ico $appl.ico Makefile appl.ico
	if exist ..\..\*.ico xcopy ..\..\*.ico .
	if exist ..\..\*.cur xcopy ..\..\*.cur .
	if exist ..\..\*.bmp xcopy ..\..\*.bmp .
	if exist ..\..\*.h xcopy ..\..\*.h .
	rc -I..\.. -r $appl.rc
-------------

and modify the last line by:

	rc -i..\.. -ic:\msdev\mfc\include -r $appl.rc


H2E utility
-----------

H2E is a convenient tool to generate an Eiffel class which contains resource
identifiers. The program and the documentation are in $EIFFEL3\util. The source
code is in $EIFFEL3\library\wel\extra.


The WEL C library
-----------------

`wel.lib' contains some C-functions needed by WEL. If you need to
recompile this library read the file $EIFFEL3\library\wel\clib\readme.txt.


Examples
--------

WEL includes a few examples (Eiffel classes and an executable) which are:

o Minimal: The minimal WEL program (in terms of lines of code able to
  create a Windows application).

o Hello: The famous ``Hello, World!'' program in WEL.

o XY: A simple program that shows the coordinates of the mouse
  when the button is pressed.

o Menus: This example illustrates dynamic creation of menus and
  track popup menus.

o Cursors: This example demonstrates how to change the cursor.

o MDI: A basic Muliple Document Interface application.

o Controls: This example demontrates several Windows controls.

o Fun: Some funny stuff using the GDI classes of WEL. (*)

o Pizza: Order your pizza with WEL.

o Brushes: A nice example to illustrate the brushes.

o Bmpview: A MDI bitmap file viewer (16-color bitmaps only).

o Windows: Shows the different kind of windows.

o Printer: A simple example to print a page.

o Xcell: A pretty nice card game. (*)

o Stddlgs: Shows all the standard dialog boxes available.

o Comctrls: Shows the new Windows 95/NT common controls supported by WEL.

o Fontenum: Demonstrates the font enumeration capability.

o Timer: Shows how to use Windows timers.

o Magnify: Tool to magnify a part of your screen.

o Richedit: A small word processor based on the rich edit control.

o Commands: Demonstrates the new command model of WEL.

All the examples (except those marked by `(*)') are compatible with Windows 95,
Windows NT and Windows 3.1 with Win32s 1.30 and above.
The examples marked by `(*)' do not work under Win32s since Win32s has DC
limitations.


Enjoy!
