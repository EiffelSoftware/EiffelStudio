<h1>Introduction</h1>
It is possible to compile from outside of the graphical environment, by
using the command <b>ec</b>. The form of compilation's results are the
same in both case. You may therefore alternate between the two techniques.
<b>ec </b>will enable you to <a href="10_command_line_options.html">melt
or freeze</a> a project and therefore to use <a href="20_batch_compilation.html">batch
compilation</a>. It will also enable you to produce such <a href="10_command_line_options.html">information
about a class</a> as its Flat and Flat Contract views.
<br>The <a href="30_interactive_mode/00_introduction.html">-loop option</a>
makes it possible to start <b>ec</b> just once and then repeatedly request
any of the available operations.
