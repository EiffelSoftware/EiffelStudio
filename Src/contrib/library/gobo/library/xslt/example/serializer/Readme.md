# Gobo Eiffel XSLT Example: serializer

This example program shows you how to invoke the XSLT serializer from
your Eiffel programs.

It is NOT necessary to use the XSLT engine to use this XML serializer.

Documentation on the XSLT serializer is available as part of the XSLT
library documentation in `${GOBO}/library/xslt/doc`.
