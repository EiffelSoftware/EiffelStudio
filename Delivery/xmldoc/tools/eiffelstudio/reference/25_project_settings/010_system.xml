			<item>Name: specifies the name fo the system  and is also used as the default for the name of the generated executable. The name of the executable can be changed in the <link><url>020_target_general.xml</url><label>target settings</label></link>.</item>
			<item>Description: an optional description about the system</item>
			<item>Library target: the target that should be used in the case that this system is used as a library</item>
			<item>UUID: unique identifier for this system</item>
			<item>Targets: targets are the main block that specify an application or library.  Targets have the ability to extend another target that has been defined before and therefore the 
				order of the targets has some importance. For example in the calculater application we have three targets: common, classic and dotnet. The common target specifies the part of 
				the application that is common to classic and .NET compilation. The dotnet and classic target extend the common target and add their specific settings.</item>
