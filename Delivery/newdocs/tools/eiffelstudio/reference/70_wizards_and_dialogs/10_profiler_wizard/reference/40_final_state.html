<h1>Select the information you need and formulate your query</h1>
<p>The final screen of the wizard lets you select the information you want
to be displayed in the profile query window.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Select the information you need</h2>
<p>Check or uncheck any of the check buttons in <b>Output switches</b> to select
the columns you want to be displayed. Each switch turns on or off the
corresponding column output. You should toggle&nbsp;columns on or off depending
on what you would like to see in the result of the computation. Here are the
explanations of each switch:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Feature name</b>: Display the name of the current feature.</li>
  <li><b>Number of calls</b>: Display the number of times the current feature
    was called during the instrumented execution.</li>
  <li><b>Function time</b>: Display the time spent in the current feature (not counting the
    time spent in features called by the current feature).</li>
  <li><b>Descendant time</b>: Display the time spent in all features called
    during the execution of the current
    feature.</li>
  <li><b>Total time</b>: Display the total time spent in the feature. This value is equal to
    <i>Function time + Descendant time</i>.</li>
  <li><b>Percentage</b>: Display the percentage of time spent in the current feature. This
    value is equal to <i>Total time / Execution time</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check or uncheck any of the check buttons in the <b>Language type</b> to
select the type of features you want to be displayed. If you select only one
language, the query result will not contain any&nbsp;information about routines
written in the other language. The default is Eiffel only.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eiffel features: Display the features written in Eiffel.</li>
  <li>C functions: Display the functions written in C.</li>
  <li>Recursive functions: Display recursive functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Formulate your query</h2>
<p>When running a query, you are able to type a complete query. After pressing
the <b>Next</b>&nbsp;button, a new window will be displayed to show the result
of the query.&nbsp;The total query can be either a single one or a set of sub-queries
separated by&nbsp;one of the two operators 'or' or 'and'.<br>
<br>
Each sub-query must have the following syntax 'attribute operator value' where:
<ul><LI>'attribute' is one of:
<ul>
  <li>featurename
  <li>calls
  <li>total
  <li>self
  <li>descendants
  <li>percentage</li>
</ul>
  <LI>'operator' is one of: &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, =, /=, in<LI>'value' is one of:
<ul>
  <li>An integer (for calls)
  <li>A string (for featurename). The string may contain wild card characters:
    ?,&nbsp;standing for arbitrary characters, and *, standing for arbitrary&nbsp;sub-strings.
  <li>A real value (for other attributes)
  <li>An interval, of the form a-b for two values a and b.
  <li>max
  <li>min
  <li>avg</li>
</ul>
</ul>
