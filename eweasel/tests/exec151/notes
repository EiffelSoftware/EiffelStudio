After initial compilation where the system is frozen, a class with
routines which raise and rescue a developer exception is modified to
add another routine into the call chain.  Also, the routine that
raises the developer exception is modified by adding a `print (Void)'
instruction.  After melting changes, system execution uses an enormous
amount of memory (nearly 2 GB) before execution ends with a
segmentation fault.

Discovered in Release 5.4.0403.
