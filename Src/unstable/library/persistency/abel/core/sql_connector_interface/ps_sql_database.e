			-- You can create a new connection to the database or use a pool of connections.
			-- It is also possible to run ABEL with only one connection. However, note that to do this, you have to ensure the following:
				-- This function always returns the same connection (the only one you have).
				-- `release_connection' should not close it
				-- Autocommit always has to stay disabled
				-- To have proper transaction support, you should create ABEL with client-side transaction management support enabled.
