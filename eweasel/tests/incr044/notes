Attributes declared as unique and introduced in the same feature
declaration are supposed to have consecutive values according to page
266.  But deleting a unique attribute and rerunning es3 can sometimes
result in unique attributes which should have consecutive values, but
do not.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
In fact, now both unique attributes have value 0, instead of remaining
1 and 3.
