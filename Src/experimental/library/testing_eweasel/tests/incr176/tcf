test_name 	 backup-directory-disaster
test_description After initial compilation, a cluster in the Ace file is changed from the form "all root_cluster" to a list of the two specific clusters in the root cluster directory.  Recompilation works fine.  However, when the Ace is then changed to indicate a new root class and and the class name inside one file is also changed, a second recompile ends with a segmentation fault in `backup_directory'.  This only happens if "automatic_backup" is true.
