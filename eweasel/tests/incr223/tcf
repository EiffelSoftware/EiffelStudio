test_name 	 function-attribute-constant
test_description A system creates an instance of a class and prints the value of its only feature, which is a function returning INTEGER.  After initial compilation where the system is frozen, the constant is changed to an INTEGER attribute and changes are melted.  System execution still produces the correct result.  Then the feature is changed to an INTEGER constant and changes are melted.  System execution then produces the wrong result (the value returned by the original function).
