feature {NONE} -- Initialization

	make
			-- Create a new parser.
		deferred

feature -- Parsing

	parse
			-- Parse input stream.
			-- Set `syntax_error' to True if
			-- parsing has not been successful.
		deferred
		end

feature -- Status report

	syntax_error: BOOLEAN
			-- Has last parsing been unsuccesful?
		deferred
		end

	is_suspended: BOOLEAN
			-- Has parsing been suspended?
			-- The next call to `parse' will resume parsing in the state
			-- where the parser was when it was suspended. Note that a call
			-- to `abort' or `accept' will force `parse' to parse from scratch.
		deferred

feature -- Access

	error_count: INTEGER
			-- Number of errors detected during last parsing
			-- (`error_count' can be non-zero even though
			-- `syntax_error' is false. This can happen when
			-- error recovery occurred.)

feature -- Basic operations

	accept
			-- Stop parsing successfully.
		deferred

	abort
			-- Abort parsing.
			-- Do not print error message.
		deferred
		ensure
			aborted: syntax_error

	clear_all
			-- Clear temporary objects so that they can be collected
			-- by the garbage collector. (This routine is called by
			-- `parse' before exiting. It can be redefined in descendants.)

	suspend
			-- Suspend parsing.
			-- The next call to `parse' will resume parsing in the state

			-- to `abort' or `accept' will force `parse' to parse from scratch.

	raise_error
			-- Raise a syntax error.
			-- Report error using `report_error' and
			-- perform normal error recovery if possible.

	recover
			-- Recover immediately after a parse error.
		deferred

			-- a syntax error. It can be redefined in descendants.)

	clear_token
			-- Clear the previous lookahead token.

	is_recovering: BOOLEAN
			-- Is current parser recovering from a syntax error?
		deferred

feature {YY_PARSER_ACTION} -- Scanning

	read_token
			-- Read a token from input stream.
			-- Make result available in `last_token'.
			-- (This routine is called by `parse' when it needs a
			-- new token from the input stream.)
		deferred
