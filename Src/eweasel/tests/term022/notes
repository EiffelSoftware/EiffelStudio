A class which inherits from an unconstrained generic class and
provides a BIT type as actual generic parameter, where the number of
bits is specified by an integer constant attribute, causes a compiler
exception trace.  If the class is instead a client of the generic
class with the same actual generic parameter, no exception trace occurs.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
