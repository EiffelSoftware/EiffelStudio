After initial compilation, a constant integer attribute referenced in
a BIT type which is the return type of a function is given a different
(larger) value.  After recompilation, the function should return a
larger BIT type during system execution but it does not.  The initial
compilation and recompilation can each be either a melt or a freeze -
the problem occurs regardless.

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
