Finalizing a particular large system with over 600 classes 
causes the compiler to die with a "no such file or directory"
error in SERVER_FILE.

Discovered in Release 5.0.024.

It was fixed by the following commit:

Fixed bug in finalization due to an out-of-bound access in the PACKED_BOOLEANS structure. The bug only occurs when finalizing with a precompiled library. The reason is that `I' thought that `type_id' of CLASS_TYPE were alwasy numbered using the topological sort of inheritance, but this is not always the case.
It can happen in two situations:
- incremental compilation: new added classes are not ordered.
- using a precompiled library, all the classes added to the system are not
  ordered.
The bug has been revealed through test `term102' of the EiffelWeasel test suite.
In this case, the deferred class A had a type id largely bigger than its implementation with the bigger type_id. So when in class A, we were trying to evaluate the polymorphism status in A of a routine f deferred implemented in some descendants, we got the out-of-bound access.
