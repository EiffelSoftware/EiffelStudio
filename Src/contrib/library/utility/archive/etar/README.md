# etar
Eiffel archiving library based on tar.

The etar adds archiving support to the Eiffel programming language. It was
developed as a project within the scope of the course "Software Engineering
Laboratory: Open-Source EiffelStudio" at ETH Zurich in autumn semester 2015.

For more information you are invited to visit the
[documentation](doc/README.md).

## Provided archives
The archive folder contains some archives. For a detailed description, view
[archives/README.md](archives/README.md).

Since some of these archives are rather large, they use git lfs.
