The internal message queue is a linked list of mc_node elements.

--------    --------    --------    --------    --------
| node | -> | node | -> | node | -> | node | -> | node | -> /
--------    --------    --------    --------    --------
   |           |                       |           |
 first     tail_copy                  tail       head


The most important node is the one pointed at by tail.
It is a guard node and contains no element itself.
Every node left from the guard node is a garbage
node that may be reused later. The nodes at the right
of the guard node contain the actual elements.

The head node points to the end of the linked list, which contains
the most recently added node. If the list is empty the head pointer
points to the guard node. To enqueue a new element a producer thus
has to extend the list at the head node.

A dequeue operation is simply done by "moving" the head pointer
one element to the right. This "thrashes" the current guard node,
and the dequeue'd element is the new guard node.

The nodes behind the guard node form a cache of reusable node
objects. They are used by the producer thread to avoid constant
memory allocation and freeing. When the cache is empty, the
first, tail_copy and tail pointers all point to the guard node.

The tail_copy is a small optimization technique which points
somewhere between first and tail. It is used to avoid frequent
synchronization. with the consumer.
