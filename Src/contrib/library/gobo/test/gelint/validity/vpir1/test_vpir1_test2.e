		"Test for validity rule VPIR-1"

	remark: "[
		In this test the formal argument `a' in an inline agent has the same
		name as the object-test local of the enclosing feature whose scope
		contains the inline agent declaration.

		ECMA 367-2, section 8.27.11 p.136: "Validity: Inline Agent Requirements"
		Validity code: VPIR-1
			An Inline_agent 'a' must satisfy the following conditions:
			1. No formal argument or local variable of 'a' has the same name as a feature
			   of the enclosing class, or a formal argument or local variable other than
			   'Result' of an enclosing feature or Inline_agent.

		This rule should be extended to say they should not have the same lower-name
		as an object-test local of an enclosing feature or inline agent whose scope
		contains the inline agent. See message sent by Eric Bezault to ECMA on 9 April 2008.
