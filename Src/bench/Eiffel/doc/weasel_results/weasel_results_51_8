The new inherited version of the feature has no precondition, which should make the alternative precondition of the redefined feature true.  But the precondition is violated when the system is executed.  Execution works correctly when the system is melted from scratch.

After initial compilation where the system is melted, the printed result is correct.  Then the type of the actual generic is changed from STRING to SEQ_STRING and changes are melted.  Execution then produces the wrong result (the same result as before).
