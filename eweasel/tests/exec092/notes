When a class has two or more parents, the invariant of the heir class
is supposed to start with the invariants of all parents in the order
of appearance of the parent clauses in the heir.  But when the system
is executed, the invariants are monitored in reverse order of the
parent clauses.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
