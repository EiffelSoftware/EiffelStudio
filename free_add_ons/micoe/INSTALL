Prerequisites
============

Unix
----

Before trying to compile mico/E make sure you have installed the
following software packages:

   o make (required)
   o C compiler and library (required):
        - gcc 2.7.2.1 or newer
   o ISE Eiffelcompiler 4.3 or newer (required)

Installation
============

The mico/E source release is shipped as a tar'ed and gzip'ed archive called

  micoe-<version>.tar.gz

Unpack the archive using the following command:

  gzip -dc micoe-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -

You are left with a new directory micoe containing the mico/E sources.  To
save you the hassle of manually editing Makefile's and such, mico/E comes 
with a configuration script that checks your system for required programs and
other configuration issues. The script, called configure, supports several
important command line options:

--help
     Gives an overview of all supported command line options.

--prefix=<install-directory>
     With this options you tell configure where the mico/E programs and
     libraries should be installed after compilation. This defaults
     to /usr/local.

--disable-precomp
     do not precompile Eiffel Libs

--disable-idl2eif
     do not compile idl2eif

--with-precomp=DIR
     use DIR for precompiled libs. This defaults to $EIFFEL4/precomp/spec/$PLATFORM.

--with-eiflib=DIR
     use DIR for Eiffel libs. This defaults to $EIFFEL4/local/library.

--disable-optimize
     do not use flag -O2 to compile eifadt.a and micoe.a

--enable
     use flag -g to compile eifadt.a and micoe.a

Now you should run configure with the proper command line options you need,
e.g.:

  cd micoe
  ./configure

Use make to start compilation and install the programs and libraries,
possibly becoming root before installation:

  make
  make install
