	description:

		"Text input files containing extended ASCII characters %
		%(8-bit code between 0 and 255). The line separtor of the %
		%underlying file system is automatically converted to %%N %
		%when read from the file. However `read_line' and `read_new_line' %
		%are able to recognize '%%N', '%%R%%N' and '%%R' as line separators."
