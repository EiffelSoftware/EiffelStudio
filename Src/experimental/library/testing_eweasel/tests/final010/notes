A system allocates an ARRAYED_LIST each of whose elements is an
ARRAYED_LIST [STRING].  It then randomly assigns into the main list a
random-length list of strings, each of whose STRING elements is a
random length.  System execution ends with a run-time panic, but only
if the system is finalized and array_optimization is on.

Discovered in Release 3.3.3.
