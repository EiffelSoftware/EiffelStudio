After initial compilation (without using a precompiled library), the
text of the root class is modified to give the class a different name.
When the system is recompiled, the compiler should report a VD30 error
(cannot find root class), but it instead terminates silently after
pass 6 on the root cluster.  The error does not occur if a precompiled
base library is used.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
