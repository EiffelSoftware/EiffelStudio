A routine `f' has a local of an expanded type, but does not reference
this local in the routine body.  The base class of the expanded type
has a creation procedure.  When the system is executed, the creation
procedure of the expanded class is not invoked when `f' is called, but
only if the system was frozen.  A melted system works correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
