					<P>Eiffel, as noted, supports the entire lifecycle. The underlying view
					of the system development lifecycle is radically different not only
					from the traditional &quot;Waterfall&quot; model (implying a sequence
					of discrete steps, such as analysis, global design, detailed design,
					implementation, separated by major changes of method and notation) but
					also from its more recent variants such as the spiral model or
					&quot;rapid prototyping&quot;, which remain predicated on a synchronous,
					full-product process, and retain the gaps between successive steps.</P>

					<P>Clearly, not everyone using Eiffel will follow to the letter the
					principles outlined below; in fact, some highly competent and successful
					Eiffel developers may disagree with some of them and use a different
					process model. In the author's mind, however, these principles fit best
					with the language and the rest of the method, even if practical
					developments may fall short of applying their ideal form.</P>

					<H2>Clusters and the cluster model</H2>

					<P>Unlike earlier approaches, the Eiffel model assumes that the system
					is divided into a number of subsystems or <SPAN CLASS="bold">
					clusters</SPAN>. It keeps from the Waterfall a sequential approach to
					the development of each cluster (without the gaps), but promotes
					<SPAN CLASS="bold">concurrent engineering</SPAN> for the overall process,
					as suggested by the following picture:</P>

					<IMG SRC="tutorial-2.png">

					<P>The Eiffel techniques developed below, in particular information
					hiding and Design by Contract&#153, make the concurrent engineering process
					possible by letting the clusters rely on each other through clearly defined
					interfaces, strictly limiting the amount of knowledge that one must acquire
					to use the cluster, and permitting separate testing. When the inevitable
					surprises of a project happen, the project leader can take advantage of the
					model's flexibility, advancing or delaying various clusters and steps
					through dynamic reallocation of resources.</P>

					<P>Each of the individual cluster lifecycles is based on a continuous
					progression of activities, from the more abstract to the more
					implementation-oriented:</P>

					<A NAME=10958></A><IMG SRC="tutorial-3.png">

					<P>You may view this picture as describing a process of accretion
					(as with a stalactite), where each steps <SPAN CLASS="italics">enriches
					</SPAN> the results of the previous one. Unlike traditional views, which
					emphasize the multiplicity of software products -- analysis document, global
					and detailed design documents, program, maintenance reports &#8230; --, the
					principle is here to treat the software as a <SPAN CLASS="bold">single
					product</SPAN> which will be repeatedly refined, extended and improved. The
					Eiffel language supports this view by providing high-level notations that
					can be used throughout the lifecycle, from the most general and
					software-independent activities of system modeling to the most exacting
					details of implementation tuned for optimal run-time performance.</P>

					<P>These properties make Eiffel span the scope of both
					&quot;object-oriented methods&quot;, with their associated notations such as
					UML and supporting CASE tools (whereas most such solutions do not yield an
					executable result), and &quot;programming languages&quot; (whereas most such
					languages are not suitable for design and analysis).</P>

					<A NAME="24218"></A><H2>Seamlessness and reversibility</H2>

					<P>The preceding ideas define the <SPAN CLASS="bold">seamless approach
					</SPAN> embodied by Eiffel. With seamlessness goes <SPAN CLASS="bold">
					reversibility</SPAN>: the ability to go back, even late in the process, to
					earlier stages. Because the developers work on a single product, they can
					take advantages of bouts of late wisdom -- such as a great idea for adding
					a new function, discovered only at implementation time -- and integrate them
					in the product. Traditional approaches tend to discourage reversibility
					because it is difficult to guarantee that the analysis and design will be
					updated with the late changes. With the single-product principle, this is
					much easier to achieve.</P>

					<P>Seamlessness and reversibility enhance extendibility by providing a
					direct mapping from the structure of the solution to the structure of the
					problem description, making it easier to take care of customers' change
					requests quickly and efficiently. They promote reliability, by avoiding
					possible misunderstandings between customers' and developers' views. They are
					a boost to maintainability. More generally, they yield a smooth, consistent
					software process that helps both quality and productivity.</P>

					<H2>Generalization and reuse</H2>

					<P>The last step of the cluster lifecycles, Generalization, is unheard of in
					traditional models. Its task is to prepare the results of a cluster for reuse
					across projects by looking for elements of general applicability, and
					transform them for inclusion in libraries.</P>

					<P>Recent object-oriented literature has used the term &quot;refactoring&quot;
					to describe a process of continuous improvement of released software.
					Generalization includes refactoring, but also pursues a more ambitious goal:
					helping turn <SPAN CLASS="italics">program elements</SPAN> (software modules
					useful only as part of a certain program) into <SPAN CLASS="italics">software
					components </SPAN>-- reusable parts with a value of their own, ready to be
					used by diverse programs that can benefit from their capabilities.</P>

					<P>Of course not all companies using the method will be ready to include a
					Generalization phase in their lifecycles. But those which do will see the
					reusability of their software greatly improved.</P>

					<H2>Constant availability</H2>

					<P>Complementing the preceding principles is the idea that, in the cluster
					lifecycle, the development team (under the responsibility of the project
					leader) should at all times maintain a <SPAN CLASS="italics">current working
					demo</SPAN> which, although covering only a part of the final system, works
					well, and can be demonstrated or -- starting at a suitable time -- shipped
					as an early release. It is not a &quot;prototype&quot; in the sense of a
					mockup meant to be thrown away, but an initial iteration towards the final
					product; the successive iterations will progress continuously towards until
					they become that final product.</P>

					<H2>Compilation technology</H2>

					<P>The preceding goals benefit from the ability to check frequently that the
					current iteration is correct and robust. Eiffel supports efficient compilation
					mechanisms through such mechanisms as the <SPAN CLASS="bold">Melting Ice
					Technology</SPAN> in ISE's EiffelStudio. The Melting Ice achieves immediate
					recompilation after a change, guaranteeing a recompilation time that's a
					function of the size of the <SPAN CLASS="italics">changes</SPAN>, not of the
					system's overall size. Even for a system of several thousand classes and
					several hundred thousand lines, the time to get restarted after a change to a
					few classes is, on a typical modern computer, a few seconds.</P>

					<P>Such a &quot;melt&quot; (recompilation) will immediately catch (along with
					any syntax errors) the type errors -- often the symptoms of conceptual errors
					that, if left undetected, could cause grave damage later in the process or even
					during operation. Once the type errors have been corrected, the developers
					should start testing the new functionalities, relying on the power of
					<SPAN CLASS="bold">assertions</SPAN> -- explained in
					<A HREF="tutorial-09.html#pgfId-514761">&quot;Design by Contract&#153T, Assertions,
					Exceptions&quot;</A> -- to kill the bugs while they are still larvae. Such
					extensive unit and system testing, constantly interleaved with development,
					plays an important part in making sure that the &quot;current demo&quot; is
					trustworthy and will eventually yield a correct and robust product.</P>

					<A NAME="94733"></A><H2>Quality and functionality</H2>

					<P>Throughout the process, the method suggests maintaining a constant
					<SPAN CLASS="bold">quality</SPAN> level: apply all the style rules, put in
					all the assertions, handle erroneous cases (rather than the all too common
					practice of thinking that one will &quot;make the product robust&quot; later
					on), enforce the proper architecture. This applies to all the quality factors
					except possibly reusability (since one may not know ahead of time how best to
					generalize a component, and trying to make everything fully general may
					conflict with solving the specific problem at hand quickly). All that varies
					is <SPAN CLASS="bold">functionality</SPAN>: as the project progresses and
					clusters come into place, more and more of the final product's intended coverage
					becomes available. The project's most common question , &quot;Can we ship
					something yet?&quot;, translates into &quot;Do we cover enough?&quot;, not
					&quot;Is it good enough?&quot; (as in &quot;Will it not crash?&quot;).</P>

					<P>Of course not everyone using Eiffel can, any more than in another approach,
					guarantee that the ideal just presented will always hold. But it is the
					theoretical scheme to which the method tends. It explains Eiffel's emphasis
					on getting everything right: the grandiose and the mundane, the structure and
					the details. Regarding the details, the Eiffel books cited in the bibliography
					include many rules, some petty at first sight, about such low-level aspects as
					the choice of names for classes and features (including their grammatical
					categories), the indentation of software texts, the style for comments
					(including the presence or absence of a final period), the use of spaces.
					Applying these rules does not, of course, guarantee quality; but they are part
					of a quality-oriented process, along with the more ambitious principles of
					design. In addition they are particularly important for the construction of
					quality libraries, one of the central goals of Eiffel.</P>

					<P>Whenever they are compatible with the space constraints, the present chapter
					and the rest of this tutorial apply these rules to their Eiffel examples.</P>
