A class has two attributes of type `expanded TEST1 [STRING]'.  TEST1
is a generic class with parent `ARRAY [expanded TEST1 [G]]'.  The
system compiles fine, but dies with an exception trace when executed.
Turning off garbage collection allows the program to run correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
