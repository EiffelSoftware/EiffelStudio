<h3>Installing ISE Eiffel</h3>
<p>Insert the CD labelled ISE Eiffel 4.5 into your CD-ROM drive and if you have
the `auto-run' setup enabled, it will launch the installation of the ISE Eiffel
environment automatically. If not, choose `setup.exe' located in `d:\' if `d:\'
is your CD-ROM location. For Windows NT/2000 users, please read the <a href="#windowsnt">section
below </a>for a specific step by step procedure needed before proceeding to the
installation.</p>
<p>After the welcome screen displayed in the installation wizard, you will be
prompted to enter your CD-Key located at the back of your CD cover.</p>
<p>Then, you will be prompted to choose the installation directory. By default,
we choose `C:\Eiffel45', you can choose any other directory, but we recommend
you to use a directory without any white space in it, due to some possible
errors during the C compilation if your C compiler does not handle white space
correctly.</p>
<p>The next screen you will get is a prompt regarding the type of installation
you are going to choose. For a first setup, we recommend you to choose
`Typical', this will install all the software, libraries and precompiled
libraries which comes with your purchased product.</p>
<p>After that you will have the choice to specify what C compiler you are going
to use. The default entry is Microsoft Visual C++ C compiler, but you can also
choose Borland C++ or No C compiler if you don't have a C compiler.</p>
<p>Then follow the instructions which appear on your screen until installation
completion. When it is finished, some shortcuts will appear on your desktop and
an entry for ISE Eiffel will be added to your start menu.</p>

      <h3><a name="windowsnt">Special instructions for Windows NT/2000:</a></h3>
      <p>When Installing ISE Eiffel on a Windows NT/2000 you need to install it
      with an account that has <b>administrator</b> privileges. When the
      installation will be finished, you will be able to use ISE Eiffel with
      this account only. If you want to use ISE Eiffel with a different user
      account, you need to log on as the specific user account after the
      completion of the installation procedure and to use the tool called `user_setup.exe'
      located in the root directory of your CD. Follow the instructions given by
      the tool to complete your user specific installation. After that you will
      be ready to run ISE Eiffel products smoothly.</p>
