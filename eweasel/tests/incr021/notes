After initial compilation, the entire text of a class A is deleted and
the system is recompiled.  The compiler correctly reports the VD10
violation.  But when compilation is resumed with no change to any
files, the compiler reports a syntax error at position 0 on class A,
though there is still no class A.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
