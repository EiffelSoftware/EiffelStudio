After initial compilation and freezing, the type of a formal argument
to routine is changed from `TEST1' to `expanded TEST1' and changes are
melted.  Since the actual argument is Void, a "void assigned to
expanded" exception should occur when the system is executed.
Instead, execution terminates with "illegal instruction" and no
exception trace.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
