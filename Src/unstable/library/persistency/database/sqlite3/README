Eiffel SQLite wrapper for http://www.sqlite.org/ library.
This provides a statically linked sqlite, based in SQLite 3.7.8

Note: the extension loading feature is DISABLED.
  The amalgamation sqlite3.c file is compiled with flag -DSQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION=1 
  If you want to use the extension loading, you will need to modify a few files
   - have a look at Clib/Makefile.SH (and on Windows Clib/Makefile-win.sh)
   - and add in the sqlite(-safe).ecf files the code
		<external_library location="`$(ISE_LIBRARY)/library/api_wrapper/implementation/unix/Clib/dl-config --library`">
			<description>Required for linking SQLite</description>
			<condition>
				<platform excluded_value="windows"/>
			</condition>
		</external_library>
   - Then you might have to solve local issues related to undefined dlopen and similar
