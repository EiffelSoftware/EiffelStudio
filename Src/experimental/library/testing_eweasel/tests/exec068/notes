A system has a class which creates a manifest array of strings with
25000 elements.  The system compiles fine when frozen, but when
executed it dies with a run-time panic while creating the manifest
array.  Turning off garbage collection allows the system to execute
correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
