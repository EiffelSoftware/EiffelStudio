A valid multi-branch containing another valid multi-branch in one of
its `when' clauses is rejected by the compiler as violating VOMB(2).
The problem only seems to occur when one of the inspect expressions is
of type INTEGER and the other is of type CHARACTER.
First reported by Timur Tabi on comp.lang.eiffel.

Discovered in release 3.2.3b.
