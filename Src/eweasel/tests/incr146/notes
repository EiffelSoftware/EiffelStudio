After initial compilation, a constraint on a formal generic parameter
of a class that is used in the generic constraint of another class is
changed.  When the system is recompiled, the compiler correctly
reports a VTCG error.  But when the constraint is changed back to its
original valid form and compilation is resumed, the compiler dies with
a bus error.

Discovered in Release 4.3-17.
