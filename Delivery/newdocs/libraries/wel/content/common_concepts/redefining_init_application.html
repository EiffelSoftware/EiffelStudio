			<P><A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/support/wel_application_chart.html">WEL_APPLICATION</A>. contains a feature <A HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/support/wel_application.html#f_init_application">init_application</A> which does nothing by default, but is called before the application
			is started. This can be redefined to execute tasks that must be performed before the application is running. A common redefinition is to allow the loading of common dll's, see <A HREF="/libraries/wel/samples/list_view/index.html">list_view</A> sample for a demonstration of this technique.</P>
