?X: This unit is the very last one in the Configure script.  It runs all the
?X: SH files, which among other things produce config.h and (usually) Makefile.
?X: It offers to do a make depend if the Makefile contains that target.

If you'd like to make any changes to the config.sh file before I begin
to configure things, do it as a shell escape now (e.g. !vi config.sh).

EOM
	rp="Press return or use a shell escape to edit config.sh:"

	nostick=''
	case "$ans" in
	'') ;;
	*) : in case they cannot read
		sh 1>&4 -c "$ans";;
	esac
	;;
esac

: if this fails, just run all the .SH files by hand
. ./config.sh

?X: Turn silent mode off from now on (we want a verbose file extraction).
?X: This means we have to explicitely test for '$silent' from now on to
?X: strip off any verbose messages.

if $contains '^depend:' [Mm]akefile >/dev/null 2>&1; then
	dflt=y

	*)
		$cat <<EOM

Now you need to generate make dependencies by running "make depend".
You might prefer to run it in background: "make depend > makedepend.out &"
It can take a while, so you might not want to run it right now.
