A system is compiled with an Ace which references a precompiled
cluster that is invalid, so it cannot be retrieved.  After the VD41
error is reported, the Ace is changed to indicate a valid precompiled
cluster.  But the compiler reports a VD41 on the new (valid)
precompiled cluster.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
