Here are some known bugs that I plan to fix soon.

+ Patname ought to ask for a log message for the symbolic number.

+ A unit name is always wanted by Configure. Hence in a unit d_waitpid, if
you write:

	@if WAITPID || d_waitpid
	.....
	@end

then the <....> part of the code will always be loaded even if no shell
script references d_waitpid or C code references WAITPID.
