A system has an Ace which specifies the precompiled cluster EiffelBase
and also has a cluster with Cluster_tag `kernel'.  After initial
compilation, the tag `kernel' is changed to `other' and the system is
recompiled.  The compiler then reports an erroneous VD28 error.

Discovered in Release 3.3 beta.
