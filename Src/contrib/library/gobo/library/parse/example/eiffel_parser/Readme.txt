This directory contains the source code for a simple Eiffel parser.
It uses Gelex to generate class EIFFEL_SCANNER and Geyacc to generate
classes EIFFEL_PARSER and EIFFEL_TOKENS.

Class EIFFEL_PARSER has three creation procedures. `make' just creates
a parser. `execute' creates a parser and parses the files given in the 
command line, one by one. `benchmark' expects the command line to be made
up of a number 'nb' followed by a filename. It creates a parser and parses
'nb' times the file given as second argument.

Note: This Eiffel parser is just a simple example. It is not intended
to be perfect or to follow any Eiffel syntax standard. Moreover, it
does not generate any abstract syntax tree and there is no output. A
full-fledged Eiffel parser is provided in the Gobo Eiffel Tools Library
in $Gobo/library/tools/eiffel/parser/.

To compile this example:

1. Use the script 'geant scanner' to generate class EIFFEL_SCANNER
   if necessary.

2. Use the script 'geant parser' to generate classes EIFFEL_PARSER
   and EIFFEL_TOKENS if necessary.

3. Choose either `execute' or `benchmark' as the creation prodecure of
   the root class EIFFEL_PARSER in your Ace, Xace or ECF file.

4. Use your favorite Eiffel compiler to compile the Eiffel system using
   the provided Ace, Xace or ECF file (e.g. <compiler>.ecf). Alternatively
   you can use 'geant' to launch the compilation:
   
       geant compile_<compiler>
       
   where <compiler> is either 'ise' or 'ge'.

5. Execute the Eiffel parser using

       eiffel_parser filename1 ...

   if you selected `execute' as creation procedure, or

       eiffel_parser nb filename

   if you selected `benchmark', where `filename', `filename1', etc. are
   filenames containing Eiffel classes and `nb' is an integer.
