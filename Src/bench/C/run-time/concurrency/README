                                    =======
   
	The version is modified on the basis of eiffel-c12
    The difference between the version and the previous version is:
	here, we use "htonl"/"ntohl" whenever we send/get data to/from network.

                            INFORMATION IN THE DIRECTORY
                            ============================



    This is the C-library for concurrent Eiffel.

    In the following, we simply introduce the files consisting the library:

    sep_obj.e: the only Eiffel class remained in the library;
    concurrency.c: functions for reading CONFIGURE file and dispatching
separate objects among network resources;
    parameter.c: functions for manipulating parameter array;
    ref_table.c: functions for manipulating REFERENCE TABLE(for exported
objects);
    server.c: functions for manipulating diferent LISTs, creating separate
objects, processing requests from other separate objects, etc. ;
    error.c: function for converting error number into error message;
    print.c: functions for printing some system information used for debugging;
    subs.c: functions for network manipulation, etc.;
    ser_list.c: functions for manipulating SERVER LIST;
    idle.c: function for making use of the waiting time(for a request from a
socket) in GET_COMMAND.
    test.c: functions for testing(No actual use now);

    concurnet.h: macro & constant definitions for network manipulation;
    constant.h: macro & constant & data structure definitions for the 
C-library;
    curextern.h: external declaration for all global variables and functions 
defined in the C-library;
    curserver.h: declaration for all global variables and external declaration 
for all functions defined in the C-library;

    All C-source files using the C-library must include "curextern.h"; 
    The C-source file "emain.c"(generated by Eiffel compiler) for an 
application must include "curserver.h".

    The functions in the C-library may access the following Eiffel classes:
        SEP_OBJ;
please keep them "visible" in your ACE file.

    The version uses the SCOOP Daemon in "../dog8" .
