		<P>When creating an attribute, it is common that you will also need a set-procedure for it. For example, for attribute <SPAN CLASS="efeature">property</SPAN> you need a procedure <SPAN CLASS="efeature">set_property</SPAN> to set it. This feature takes one argument of the same type as <SPAN CLASS="efeature">property</SPAN> or is anchored to it. The only thing you have to do with the feature wizard is check the button <B>Generate set procedure</B>.</P>

		<P>The feature that is generated in addition to the attribute itself is placed in feature clause <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">Element change</SPAN> and is exported to all classes. If you have selected or entered an invariant, the precondition will protect this invariant. Example of a generated set-procedure:</P>
