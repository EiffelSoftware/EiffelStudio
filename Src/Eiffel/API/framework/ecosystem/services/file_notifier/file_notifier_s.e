	description: "[
		Service interface for working with files and recieving notification regarding changes to those files.
		
		Note: Unfortunatly this service cannot provide "live" monitored support currently because Unix does not
		      provide file system event monitoring. As such `check_modifications' should be called when a check
		      needs to be made. Prior to the call ensure clients wanting notification have subscribed to the 
		      `file_modified_events' events.
		      
		      Please be sure to also call `uncheck_modifications' to release a monitor on the file when a monitor is no longer needed.
