<P>The EiffelBuild preferences are used to handle all user defined preferences. For example, each time a dialog is displayed with a "do not show again" option, your chosen setting is recorded in the preferences. Various properties of the EiffelBuild interface are recorded by the preferences, on a user by user basis, permitting you to adapt the behaviour of EiffelBuild to suit your needs.</P>
<P>During use of EiffelBuild, many settings and options that you select, will modify the preferences, ensuring the desired behaviour is maintained. To access all of the available EiffelBuild preferences, you may use the Preferences dialog, accessible from the "View", "Preferences", "Preferences..." menu option. The preference dialog has the following appearence:</P>

To modify the value of a paticular preference, double click on its "Literal Value" which displays a small dialog permitting modification of the value. Dependent on the type of the property, the dialog displayed may change appropriately.</P>
<P>The button marked "Restore Defaults" in the lower left hand corner of the dialog, may be selected to restore the preferences back to their defaults when EiffelBuild was first launched.</P>
<P>When you have finished modifying the preferences, select the "Close" button to close the dialog.</P>
