		</paragraph>
		<paragraph >Indeed, it is actually easy to compare smaller scopes (such as features, classes and clusters) one to another among the same project. But this is different for systems since one project contains one and only one system. That is why archives have been created, to store measures for a given system when it is loaded and retrieve them later on when another system is being loaded.</paragraph>
		<paragraph >The metric tool allows two kinds of facilities concerning archives:</paragraph>
