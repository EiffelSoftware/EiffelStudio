						To create a DESC object representing a library and load that library,
						use  a declaration such as:</p>
						
					<CODE>
						<SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">:</SPAN>
						<SPAN CLASS="eclass"><A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">

					<P>
						where <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN> should be replaced by whatever name you have chosen to
						denote the library in your software, and execute a creation instruction of the form:</p>
						
					<CODE>
						<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">create</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="elocal">make</SPAN>
						(<SPAN CLASS="estring">"your_lib_name"</SPAN>)
					</CODE>
					
					<P>

					<P>
