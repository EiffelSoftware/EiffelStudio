		<H1>EiffelVision 2 Primitives</H1>
			<P>All Vision2 primitives inherit <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/primitives/ev_primitive_chart.html">EV_PRIMITIVE</A>.
			<P>
			<H2>What is a primitive?</H2>
			A primitive is a Vision2 widget that may not contain other widgets. Primitives may be placed in <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/widgets/containers/index.html">containers</A>, but
        a <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/widgets/index.html">widget </A>may
        not contain any child widgets.&nbsp; Some examples of primitives are <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_button_chart.html">EV_BUTTON</A> and
			<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_label_chart.html">EV_LABEL</A>.&nbsp;
        A list of all the classes in the primitives cluster may be found <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/primitives/index.html">here</A>.&nbsp;
		<H2>Features of a primitive</H2>
			<P>
			All primitives inherit from <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/properties/ev_tooltipable_chart.html">EV_TOOLTIPABLE</A> and therefore can have tooltips assigned to them. They all inherit many features from <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chart.html">EV_WIDGET</A>
			Each descendent of <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/primitives/ev_primitive_chart.html">EV_PRIMITIVE</A> will typically have many available features, specific to their type. For example,
			<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/primtives/ev_separator_chart.html">EV_SEPARATOR</A> has no extra features, but
			<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_label_chart.html">EV_LABEL</A> has features for modifying the current font and also the text to de displayed.
			</p>
		<H2>Widgets as item holders</H2>
        <P>
		Although no primitive can contain another widget, certain primitives may contain one or more <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/items/index.html">items</A>.&nbsp;
        One example of this is an EV_LIST containing EV_LIST_ITEMs.&nbsp; For a
        more detailed description of items, click <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/items/index.html">here</A>.
