<h1>New class command</h1>
<p>The new class command ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_class_small_color.gif"> )
located in the cluster tool toolbar creates a class
in the same fashion as the main new class
command. The only difference is that when using the cluster tool command, the
new class is by default located in the cluster selected in the <A HREF="10_cluster_tree.html">cluster tree</a>
(or the selected class's parent cluster, if a class is selected).<p>A dialog is
then popped up in which it is possible to select the name of the new class, the
name of the file it should be created in (by default &quot;.e&quot; is appended
to the name of the new class to generate the file name), and
the cluster in which the new class should be inserted. Only clusters that are
not libraries are displayed in the list, since library clusters cannot be
modified.<p>SCREENSHOT(new class dialog)
