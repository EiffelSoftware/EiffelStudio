<h1>EXCEPTIONS</h1>
<h2>Used .NET classes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>EXCEPTION_MANAGER
	<li>EXCEPTION
	<li>EIFFEL_EXCEPTION
</ul>
<h2>Static methods used</h2>
<ul>
	<li>{EXCEPTION_MANAGER}.last_exception, raise
</ul>
<h2>Security notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>None.
</ul>
<h2>Unhandled exceptions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When calling die, a security exception may be raised.
</ul>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Couldn't implement the catch/ignore features.
	<li>Added the EIFFEL_EXCEPTION and EXCEPTION_MANAGER classes to base.
	<li>The original exception system is not well supported, we use the Inner exceptions instead.
	We have to modify the Eiffel run-time so that when an exception is raised in a rescue clause,
	it is created with an inner exception which should be the exception that brought the user into the rescue clause.
	<li>When querying the class in which the exception was raised, I'm not sure it returns the dynamic type of the feature,
	but maybe the written-in type, or maybe something else (I don't quite know what ReflectedType returns).
	<li>Don't know how to implement the (no_)message_on_failure.
</ul>
