A class with a prefix feature that is an attribute compiles fine when
frozen, but the generated C code won't compile.  Melted code works
fine.  Fixing the generated C code by adding the missing "\" escape
characters before double quote characters inside a C string allows the
code to compile and produce the correct result.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
