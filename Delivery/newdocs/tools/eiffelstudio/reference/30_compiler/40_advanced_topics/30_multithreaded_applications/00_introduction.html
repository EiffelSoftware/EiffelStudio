        <p>Information about usage of threads in ISE Eiffel is contained in the <A HREF="/libraries/thread/reference/introduction.html">EiffelThread library</A>
        documentation. In this section we will only see what is required to <a href="10_compilation.html">enable
        threading at the level of the compiler</a> options and how to create
        special type of onces: <a href="20_once_features.html">global once
        versus once per thread</a>.<p>Users of the EiffelThread library in
        version 4.5 and older should read &quot;<a href="30_changes_between_45_and_50.html">changes
        between 4.5 and 5.0</a>&quot; to get the info they need to migrate their
        code to the new implementation of threads in Eiffel.
        <p>If you encounter problems, have a look at the <A HREF="/libraries/thread/content/20_faq.html">FAQ list</A>.</p>
