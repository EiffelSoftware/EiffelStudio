test_name 	finalize-pass-wrong-argument
test_description Finalizing a particular system with a function call whose argument is a manifest array produces C code which compiles fine.  But when the system is executed, a segmentation fault occurs.  If the system is instead melted or frozen, system execution works as expected.  This appears to be a code generator problem.
