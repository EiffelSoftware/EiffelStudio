A routine has a postcondition which references an "old" expression.
The body of the routine raises an exception which is retried by the
rescue clause.  When postconditions are monitored and the system is
melted, the "old" expression is incorrectly evaluated again when the
retry instruction is executed.  Frozen code does not re-evaluate the
"old" expression when it does a retry.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
