<h2>New functionalities:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> New EiffelCOM library (see <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/products/com"> http://www.eiffel.com/products/com</a> for more details).</li>
  <p>
  <li> Faster C compilation on all platforms. The gain is about 5 to 10 times faster than it used to be in previous version of ISE EiffelBench. The
improvement varies from the C compiler you are using.</li>
  <p>
  <li> New `finish_freezing.exe' on Windows:
    <ol>
      <li> it is now offering a silent mode, so that you can launch it in a batch file without any user intervention. To use it simply add
`-silent' as a command line argument.</li>
      <li> it is offering the following command line option `-location' which will let you launch
        `finish_freezing.exe' on a specific directory,
for example: `finish_freezing -silent -location $MY_PROJECT\F_code'.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <p>
  <li> New lace option `shared_library_definition' and simplified the generation process of a system into a shared library, no more user intervention is
    required (To know more click <a href="C_ext.html">here</a>).</li>
  <p>
  <li> New lace keyword `all' to build `Recursive clusters' which simplifies the writting and improves the readability of an Ace file: Just add `all' in
front of the cluster name and all subdirectories will be compiled. Look at
    $EIFFEL4\precomp\spec\$PLATFORM\base for an example of its use (To know more
    click <a href="C_ext.html">here</a>).</li>
  <p>
  <li> New improved C and C++ ANSI code generation.</li>
  <p>
  <li> New Eiffel parser completely rewritten in Eiffel: no more length
    limitations:
    <ol>
      <li> number of generic parameters</li>
      <li> length of identifiers</li>
      <li> length of manifest string</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <p>
  <li> New way to look at <b> STRING</b> objects in the debugger:
    <ol>
      <li> When the size of the <b> STRING</b> object is bigger than 50 characters, three dots will appear at the end.</li>
      <li> The following Eiffel <b> STRING</b> object &quot;Hello,%N%THow are
        you?%N%TRegards,%N%TManu&quot;&nbsp;<br>
     will appear now appear like:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hello,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How
        are you?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Regards<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Manu&quot;<br>
     This makes it easier for those  manipulating large SQL queries command with EiffelStore.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <p>
  <li> New behavior on Windows when executing your program from ISE EiffelBench:
  if your application produces some output, the message `Press Return to finish
  execution...' will appear, so that you can see the output. However, when
  launched outside of ISE EiffelBench this message won't appear (To know more
    click <a href="C_ext.html">here</a>)..</li>
  <p>
  <li> New C/C++ macro encapsulation: you can now use the following
  "C [macro &lt;fd.h>]" to generate a macro defined in a C++ header
  which requires to be compiled with the C++ flags. Therefore,
  you can now write "C++ [macro &lt;fd.h>]" and it will be correctly
  handled by the Eiffel compiler (To know more click <a href="C_ext.html">here</a>).</li>
  <p>
  <li> New C/C++ struct encapsulation: you can now encapsulate struct
  without having to write a line of C/C++ code in a header file
  as it was done before (To know more click <a href="C_ext.html">here</a>).</li>
  <p>
  <li> New `dll32' and `dllwin32' implementation for Windows. Now, `dll32' is used to call C functions exported in a DLL, whereas `dllwin32' is used
    to call C functions exported in a DLL with the `__stdcall' mechanism, mostly used by the Win32
    API&nbsp; (To know more click <a href="C_ext.html">here</a>).</li>
  <p>
  <li> Removed `dll16' as a recognized sublanguage name, user will have to switch
    to `dll32' (To know more click <a href="C_ext.html">here</a>).</li>
  <p>
  <li> Removed `consistent' and `setup' from <b> GENERAL</b> in order to increase the
  compatibility of ISE libraries with the ELKS 95 standard.</li>
  <p>
  <li> Added a new class <b> PROFILING_SETTING</b> in EiffelBase to help you to
    configure the Eiffel profiler and to get the best out of it (To know more
    click <a href="profiler.html">here</a>).</li>
  <p>
  <li> Added a new class <b> INTEGER_INTERVAL</b> in EiffelBase to represent contiguous
  integer intervals.</li>
  <p>
  <li> Added in <b> INDEXABLE</b> a new feature `index_set: <b>INTEGER_INTERVAL</b>'. This can
  produce some incompatibility with your existing code if you are using the
  name `index_set' or if you have some repeated inheritance where `index_set'
  from <b> INDEXABLE</b> has been redefined in two different ways. If you have such
  problems, please use the old version of the EiffelBase library which does
  not contain this feature in `$EIFFEL4|library|compatible_base'.</li>
  <p>
  <li> Revisited STRING class:
    <ol>
      <li> Added `infix "+"' in class <b> STRING</b> to concatenate two Eiffel strings.</li>
      <li> Now, STRING can have more than once creation routine and we provide
     two new ones `make_from_string' and `make_from_c'.</li>
      <li> `set_count' is now exported to the new added class <b>STRING_HANDLER</b>,
     so that people who needs to have access to this feature can simply
	 inherits from it (To be used with caution).</li>
      <li> Improved performance of class STRING to reduce memory allocation
     request when calling `make (0)'.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <p>
  <li> Added in class <b> POINTER</b> the new following features:
    <ol>
      <li> `infix "+" (offset: <b>INTEGER</b>): <b>POINTER</b>' which returns the current
      pointer moved by an offset of `offset' bytes.</li>
      <li>`memory_copy' and `memory_move' which corresponds to the C ANSI
      functions `memcpy' and `memmove'.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <p>
  <li> Finalizing when using a precompiled library does not cost any speed
  performance to the finalized application, just a small memory overhead
  due to larger static data.</li>
  <p>
  <li> Improved runtime performance when inserting Eiffel objects in large
  arrays.</li>
  <p>
  <li> New CECIL features to make CECIL easier to use for novice and non-novice
  CECIL programmers (To know more about CECIL click <a href="cecil.html">here</a>).</li>
  <p>
  <li> New EiffelStore library which can handle ODBC v.3.0 and Oracle 8.0.4 and
  Oracle 8i.</li>
  <li> New Support Web Pages with a new knowledge base where you can find a lot
    of useful information about ISE's products (Click <a href="http://support.eiffel.com">here</a>
    to go to the support web pages).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>
Bug fixes from 4.4:
</h2>

<ul>
  <p><li>Fixed a very old appearance bug on Windows 95 and 98: when creating a new project all directory names were shown in their DOS format and not in their<br>
  long name format. User of ISE EiffelBench on these platforms will appreciate it.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed some crashes when displaying the flat-short or the debuggable format
    of certain features.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed a bug which occurs when asking the clickable format of a class which
    was not part of your system.</li>
  <p><li>ISE EiffelBench runs smoothly on the Windows 2000 Release Candidate 2.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed a bug which was making ISE EiffelBench to reject the following code:
    When redefining in class B a feature `f: like Current' from class A as `Result := Precursor', ISE EiffelBench will generate a validity error
    because it thinks that the source and the target do not have the same type where it should be valid.</li>
  <p><li>Changing the assertion level will not freeze your system anymore.</li>
  <p><li>Assertion checkings are now threaded-safe.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed a problem with once functions which were not initialized correctly if their return type was a basic type.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed a bug in the implementation of `conforms_to' in class GENERAL.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed some memory corruption due to the use of Agents.</li>
  <p><li>Reallocating an array, a string or a special object with a size bigger than 2^26 would crash the run-time, now you it won't but
    there is still a limitation to a size of "(2^27) - 1" for Eiffel objects. When we try to allocate more than "(2^27) -1" it will
    raise an out-of-memory exception.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed a wrong implementation in class UNIX_FILE_INFO of the following features:
    <ol>
      <li>`is_access_readable'</li>
      <li>`is_access_writable'</li>
      <li>`is_access_executable'</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <p><li>Calling `generator' or `generating_type' on basic types will now returns the correct value, i.e. the basic type class and not its counterpart
    reference class (for example, INTEGER instead of INTEGER_REF).</li>
  <p><li>Fixed a bug where calling `default' from GENERAL on a basic type was causing a crash of your application if the code was melted.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed the implementation of WEL_RICH_EDIT with the incorrect use of the WEL_RICH_EDIT_STREAM. This was making some of the ISE applications to
    crash when opening a window containing a Rich-Edit control.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed in WEL: the features `move' and `move_absolute' from WEL_COMPOSITE_WINDOW has been changed to fix a bug where
    `move_absolute' was not doing what we expect to do. Therefore, programs that are using them have to make sure to update accordingly.
    We have updated the EiffelVision library.</li>
  <p><li>Fixed runtime memory leaks for Embedded Eiffel.</li>
