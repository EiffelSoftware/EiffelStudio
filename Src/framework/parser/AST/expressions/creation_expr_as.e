feature {NONE} -- Initialization

	initialize (t: like type; c: like call)
			-- Create a new CREATION_EXPR AST node.
		require
			t_not_void: t /= Void
		do
			type := t

feature -- Visitor

	process (v: AST_VISITOR)

feature -- Access

	type: TYPE_AS
			-- Creation Type.

	call: detachable ACCESS_INV_AS
			-- Routine call: it is an instance of ACCESS_INV_AS because
			-- only procedure and functions are valid and no export validation
			-- is made.

feature -- Comparison

	is_equivalent (other: like Current): BOOLEAN
			-- Is `other' equivalent to the current object ?
		do
			Result := equivalent (call, other.call) and then
				equivalent (type, other.type)
		end

invariant
		-- A creation expression contains its type
	type_exists: type /= Void
