A class with a VUAR violation is compiled and the compiler detects the
error.  When the type of the actual argument is changed to fix the
error, the compiler later dies with an exception trace.  The trace
indicates that `update_types' was applied to a void reference.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
Fixed in Prerelease 93.07.15.
