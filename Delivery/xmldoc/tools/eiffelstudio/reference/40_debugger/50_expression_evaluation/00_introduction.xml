		<paragraph>The expression evaluation tool makes it possible to evaluate expressions while the application is stopped. A typical use for it is if you would like to know the result an external feature would return. Since you do not have access to the C memory of the application, doing this is impossible. You may also want to know the result of an Eiffel feature whose body is too complex for you to evaluate.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>In these cases (and any other that suits you), you should use the dynamic expression evaluation. Simply 
			<link>
				<url>20_new_expression_dialog.xml</url>
				<label>define the expression</label>
			</link> and its result will be immediately available in the 
			<link>
				<url>10_expression_list.xml</url>
				<label>list of expressions</label>
			</link>.
		</paragraph>
		<warning>
			<bold>Caution</bold>: During the evaluation of an expression, all features that are necessary to obtain the result are called. Therefore, you should avoid calling queries that have side-effects, since doing so may alter the program execution. The Eiffel methodology recommends not to define side-effects queries anyway.
