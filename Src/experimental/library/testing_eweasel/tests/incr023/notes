When a system is compiled and then a violation of the Expanded Type
rule is introduced, the compiler detects the VTEC violation.  But when
the offending class is returned to its original state (thereby
removing the violation) and compilation is resumed, an exception trace
results.

Found in Prerelease 93.07.15.
