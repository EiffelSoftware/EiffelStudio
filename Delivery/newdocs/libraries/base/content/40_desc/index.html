		<H1>DESC Overview</H1>
		<P>
			The DESC mechanism enables you to construct objects representing external
			routines determined at execution time through their name and libraries, and
			call these routines with the appropriate arguments.
		<P>
			Two classes, <A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A> and
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine_chart.html">DLL_32_ROUTINE</A>
			, supported by an auxiliary class
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_constants_chart.html">
			SHARED_LIBRARY_CONSTANTS</A> provide the basis for DESC under	Windows:
		<UL>
			<LI>An instance of class
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A> describes
			a 32-bit Dynamically Linked Library. This class is a descendant of the deferred
			class <A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_chart.html">
			SHARED_LIBRARY</A>, covering the platform-independent notion of shared
			library.
			<LI>An instance of class
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine_chart.html">DLL_32_ROUTINE</A>
			describes a routine from a 32-bit DLL. Predictably, this class has an attribute of type
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A> describing the
			library to which the routine belongs. It has a deferred ancestor
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_routine_chart.html">
			SHARED_LIBRARY_ROUTINE</A> capturing the platform-independent notion of
			shared library routine.
			<LI><A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_constants_chart.html">
			SHARED_LIBRARY_CONSTANTS</A> introduces a few declarations useful for
			dealing with shared libraries and routines, in particular a few integer constants
			describing error codes and type codes. It is an ancestor to both of the preceding
			classes; application classes using DESC can also inherit from it to gain access
			to its facilities.
		</UL>
		<P>
			The basic sequence of instructions to use the DESC mechanism is the following:
		<OL>
			<LI><A HREF="library.html">Create</A> a library object (an instance of
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A>, providing the
			library's name as argument to the creation procedure.
			<LI><A HREF="routine.html">Create</A> a routine object (an instance of
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine_chart.html">DLL_32_ROUTINE</A>
			), providing the library object, the routine's name or index in the library, and the
			routine's signature - number of arguments, types of arguments, type of result
			if any - as arguments to the creation procedure.
			<LI><A HREF="routine_call.html">Apply</A> procedure
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine.html#f_call">call</A>
			to the routine object, passing an array that contains the actual arguments
			required by the external routine.
		</OL>
		<P>
			Each of these steps may be repeated as often as necessary to use multiple libraries,
			multiple routines in a library, or multiple calls to a given routine.
