A class does an `independent_store' of an object that has two expanded
attributes, where each expanded object has an INTEGER attribute and
another attribute of an expanded type.  Freezing the system works
fine, but during execution when the stored object is retrieved, a
floating point exception occurs.  Finalizing the system produces C
code that won't compile.
