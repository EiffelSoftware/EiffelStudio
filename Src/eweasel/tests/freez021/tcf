test_name 	dispose-with-rescue
test_description A class calls a routine and violates its precondition.  The exception is not rescued but printing of exception trace on failure is turned off.  The class has a `dispose' routine which does nothing, but has an empty rescue clause.  System execution ends with a segmentation fault when the system is frozen.  Melted code works correctly.
