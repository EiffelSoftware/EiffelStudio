		<paragraph>Now that we have defined all basic notions such as metrics, metric hierarchy and scopes, let us see how the metric tool can help in evaluating a project.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Many commands are provided in the tool to compute measures and handle them. Indeed, it is possible to calculate metrics, save measures in order to retrieve them later on, or request details for a given measure.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>To perform a measure, you simply choose a metric and a scope, and request the computation, by clicking the "Run selected metric" button. This operation allows to evaluate the selected metric over the selected scope. The measure is displayed in the provided text field.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>If you want to enumerate all the results, you can click the "Run selected metric and show detailed result" button, it will bring you to the <bold>Detailed Result</bold> tab.</paragraph>
