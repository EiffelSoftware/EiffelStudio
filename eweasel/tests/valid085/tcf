test_name 	 secret-precondition-heir-export
test_description A routine with a secret precondition does not violate VAPE because the routine itself is also exported to {NONE}.  But the class containing this routine is inherited by another class and the routine export status is changed to {ANY}, yielding a generally available routine with a secret precondition.
