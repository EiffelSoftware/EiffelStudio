\noindent 
Review held: 08 Sep 1999, ISE meeting room.

Present at review: Manus Stapf, Sam O'Connor, Andreas Leitner, Julian Rogers,
 Alex Buoy & Ian King

Cvs tag of version reviewed: REVIEW_1_990907
\layout Section

Agenda
\layout Standard

Conduct a full review of the source code of the vision 2 library.
 
\newline 
To evaluate aspects of the current quality of the source code and the programmin
g API it provides:
\layout Itemize

completness
\layout Itemize

feature naming consistency
\layout Itemize

consistent use of contracts
\layout Itemize

consistent indexing clauses and comments 
\layout Itemize

areas flaged as needing more attenetion in the code
\layout Standard

The review will not aim to correct these problems but simply take note of
 where they exist.
\newline 
The actions required to fix any problems found will only be decided on after
 the review.
\layout Section

Progress
\layout Standard

The review only covered a handfull of classes but many important general
 issues were raised.
 The group will meet again to decide on a more streamlined way to review
 the remaining classes.
 This will be facilitated by a set of standards emerging from the first
 meeting.
\layout Standard

The report covers standards and actions decided on during the review as
 well as the basic report of the classes reviwed.
\layout Part

Design decisions
\layout Enumerate

Vision2 object will not be reusable, that is to say that calling a crealtion
 procedure after creation will be illegal.
 This will be supported by class invariants.
 In the event that it is benefical to reuse objects for perfomance reasons
 special remake features will be provided.
\newline 
keywords: create make reuse
\layout Enumerate

A feature that expilicitly destroys an EV object is not needed.
 If you want to hide it, use hide.
 If you want to remove it from its parent window reparent it to Void.
 If you want it's memory to be freed, don't worry, after all the referneces
 are gone the GC will call EV_ANY_I dispose which will decreace reference
 counts on the C objects.
\newline 
keywords: external destroy dispose
\layout Enumerate

FIXME Proposed: The eiffel EV objects should not try to mirror the state
 of the native toolkit objects, rather they should inspect the actual state
 when needed.
 If the result of a query is an EV class corresponding to a C object that
 came from such an inspection, then a global hash table should be checked
 for exising corresponding EV objects, when the check fails a new object
 will be created and added to the hash table.
 (has table must usi OIDs to avoid extra references foiling the GC)
\newline 
This removes the problem of having to gaurntee that the eiffel object knows
 how to keep track of the state of the C object, (it would seem that this
 is non trivial, for instance gtk_container_destroy destroys all of it's
 contained wdigets, mabey this will cause problems if the eiffel side was
 independantly tracking the widgets).
\newline 
keywords: external destroy hash
\layout Enumerate

Hash table of C pointers -> OIDS
\newline 
EV_ obj create -> ++ GTK ref,
\newline 
EV_ obj dispose -> detach all callbacks -> -- GTK ref -> remove self from
 hash table
\newline 
require externals to be coupled everywhen in _I
\newline 
ensure command/query seperation (REALY)
\newline 
Contracts for the interface are like this: invariant ensures that implementation
 exists.
 postconditions of features foo that just call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Result := implementation.foo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 should be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Result := implementation.foo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\layout Enumerate

require: not is_initialized in all creation procedures
\layout Enumerate

Color should be 0->1 not 0->255
\layout Enumerate

prefered widget construction method is somthing like:
\newline 
create my_window.make (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Window title
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

)
\newline 
create my_hbox.make
\newline 
my_window.add (my_hbox)
\newline 
create my_label.make (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

this is a label
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

)
\newline 
create my_button.make (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

OK
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

)
\newline 
my_hbox.add (my_label)
\newline 
my_hbox.add (my_button)
\layout Enumerate

New creation regieme:
\newline 
EV_ANY has forzen make that calls defered real_make.
 
\newline 
Subclasses are contractualy obliged to call make and initialize exactly
 once each during creation.
\newline 
EV_ANY_I has defered make and frozen base_make that takes and assigns interface:
 EV_ANY.
\newline 
subclasses are contractualy obliged to call base_make exactly once during
 creation.
\layout Enumerate

Creation procedures:
\newline 
every interface class will have make (no args) that creates a valid, initialized
 object.
\newline 
any convenience procedures like make_with_text or make with_parent will
 call make first then preform any additional tasks using the interfcace.
\layout Enumerate

Splash screens do not belong in EV_APPLICATION, if they are really needed
 we can have EV_SELF_PROMOTING_APPLICATION -> EV_APPLICATION and introduce
 splashscreens there :) (The current implementation is broken anyway)
\layout Part

Standards
\layout Subsection

Comments
\layout Standard

All comments must:
\layout Enumerate

start with a capital letter and end with a full stop,
\layout Enumerate

be worded as a question for boolean features (with a question mark),
\layout Enumerate

use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

assign
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

,
\layout Enumerate

not use `the' (Check this),
\layout Enumerate

quote Current as `Current',
\layout Enumerate

quote True and False as `True' and `False'.
 (Check),
\layout Enumerate

read correctly from the `is'.
 (Check the book for guidelines) and
\layout Enumerate

have a descriptions of the units that apply to its arguments,
\layout Subsection

Indentation
\layout Enumerate

Tab stops in editors must be set to eight spaces.
\layout Enumerate

Indentation must be done with tabs only, never spaces.
\layout Subsection

Indexing clauses
\layout Standard

\begin_float margin 
\layout Standard

needs more work when propper standard is defined
\end_float 
\layout Enumerate

Always use the standard text provided for starting your class comments.
\layout Enumerate

No header should include author.
\layout Enumerate

A keywords field should be included even if empty.
\layout Enumerate

Use %N% to separate class description lines.
 (See new style in compiler RSN)
\layout Subsection

Features which take a boolean
\layout Enumerate

No feature should take a single boolean, it must be split into two features.
\layout Enumerate

Such feature pairs must use the enable_x/disable_x naming pattern.
\layout Subsection

Boolean features
\layout Enumerate

Use 
\family typewriter 
is_
\family default 
 at the start where possible (or 
\family typewriter 
has_
\family default 
 check this).
\layout Enumerate

Use positive names i.e.
 is_valid instead of is_invalid.
\layout Enumerate

Never include the reverse feature.
\layout Subsection

Creation style
\layout Enumerate

Replace !! with create.
\layout Enumerate

Replace creation with create.
\layout Enumerate

After create, each new valid routine must start on a new line.
\layout Subsection

Miscellaneous
\layout Enumerate

All magic numbers must be removed.
 Never use `variable := 5', use a pre-defined constant instead.
 (0 and 1 are somtimes magic numbers too so be careful)
\layout Enumerate

Only standard feature clauses should be used.
 
\layout Enumerate

\begin_float margin 
\layout Standard

we need a more detailed standard on contracts
\end_float 
Every feature should have a post condition, no matter how simple.
\layout Enumerate

Any inherited feature that are not used should be exported to none.
\layout Enumerate

All once functions should have a post condition of `ensure not Void'.
\layout Enumerate

Use --| for internal/sensitive comments.
\layout Enumerate

Use `fix me' in comments when required, along with date, author and problem
 description.
\layout Enumerate

Implementation should never be exported.
\layout Enumerate

Property descriptions should have `able' on the end of the name if applicable.
\layout Enumerate

For commands binding features, group adds together, also group removes together.

Tasks
\layout Section

General Tasks
\layout Enumerate

[Alex] Think about a way of enforcing critical feature calling in creation
 routines (such as calling widget_make in a widget creation routine).
 Mabey this can be achieved via the setting of a flag in the critical routine
 and having an invariant that it must be set.
\layout Enumerate

Create a new abstration class EV_DEVICE for I/O (and other?) devices, Mouse
 (infinite no of buttons), Screen, Printer.
\layout Enumerate

[Andy] Create a slots abstraction for attaching commands to events.
\layout Section

Specific tasks
\layout Enumerate

[Ian] Confirm currently correct copyright notice, find script for updating
 notices in the source or wirte a new one and update the copyright notice
 at the end of every class.
 (the pipe `|' should be removed from the `comment out' out of the notice)
\layout Enumerate

[Julian] Decide on standard indexing clauses, need to add some kind of keyword
 field.
 (See clauses generated by Case for ideas)
\layout Enumerate

Apply indexing clause standard to every class, descriptions need to be more
 descriptive.
\layout Enumerate

Check quotes in comments : 'cmd' should be `cmd' (First check in OOCS2 which
 things should be quoted)
\layout Enumerate

Insert full stops (.) at the end of every comment
\layout Enumerate

Change all instances of 
\family typewriter 
creation
\family default 
 to 
\family typewriter 
create
\layout Enumerate

Change all instances of !! (and !CLASS!) to create (see David for more details)
\layout Enumerate

Make sure all creation procedure declarations are on separate lines : 
\newline 
create
\newline 
make1,
\newline 
make2
\layout Enumerate

Check spellings in comments (American English)
\layout Enumerate

Define standard for feature clause categorisations.
 (Based on OOSC2 )
\layout Enumerate

Check all feature clause comments (Status Report, Access, Initialisation
 etc), make sure features are correctly categorised.
 
\layout Enumerate

Check that all inherited and localy defined features are set to 
\family typewriter 
export {NONE}
\family default 
 unless they are a needed part of the interface.
 (eg Restrict export of 'implementation' feature)
\layout Enumerate

Add post conditions to 
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
\size large 
ALL
\family default 
\series default 
\size default 
 routines.
\layout Enumerate

Check all post conditions for maximum possible assertions.
\layout Enumerate

Make sure all contracts are as tight as possible
\layout Enumerate

Check 
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
\size large 
ALL
\family default 
\series default 
\size default 
 routines for postconditions.
\layout Enumerate

Re-word comments as though read directly from the 'is' (Check OOSC2 for
 the standard on this)
\layout Enumerate

Remove mutual boolean features, (is_hidden/is_shown), choosing only the
 positive one (is_shown)
\layout Enumerate

Chage every feature that takes a single boolean into two features.
 
\family typewriter 
set_enabled(BOOLEAN)
\family default 
 should be split to 
\family typewriter 
set_enabled
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
set_disabled
\layout Enumerate

[IAN] Create a tool that strips out piped comments (--|) used for internal/sensi
tive commenting not required in interface short-form and not to be shipped
 to clients.
 Make one of the pre delivery tests: grep for pipe comments == {}
\layout Enumerate

Define standard for 'fix-me' in --| comments then check all classes for
 other standards and convert them.
\layout Enumerate

Check that all features taking integer arguments clearly specify the units
 of the arguments in the comment.
 (ie pixels, points, miles, logical size, etc...)
\layout Enumerate

Make sure 'add' routines declarations are 'inline', the same applies to
 `set' routines.
\layout Enumerate

Re-implement EV_SPLIT_AREA in 100% pure Vision
\layout Enumerate

Separate viewport from scrolling window to allow viewport to be used without
 scrollbars.
\layout Enumerate

[Julian] When a window is set to modal and shown, implement a mechanism
 that greys out all of the other windows governed by the application
\layout Enumerate

Look for needed invariants in the class text (such as exists: not destroyed)
 in EV_UNTITLED_WINDOW (I think)
\layout Enumerate

Revise the standards section above to ensure is accuratly captures all informati
on from the above tasks.
\layout Enumerate

Redesign EV_CURSOR, at them moment it is impossible to implement on GTK.

EV_PND_SOURCE
\layout Enumerate

Remove "the" from the comment of feature `data_type'.
 (The same is true for many more comments!)

`set_* ' features require always postconditions, often preconditions, comments
 should tell what units are used.
\layout Enumerate

Rename feature `transportable' to `is_transportable'.
\layout Enumerate

Remove the "the" from the comment of feature `transportable' resp.
 `is_transportable'.

WIDGETS
\layout Subsubsection

EV_WIDGET
\layout Enumerate

Feature `make' needs a postcondition.
\layout Enumerate

`widget_make' needs a description, a better name.
 It needs to be assured that it will be called in any creation procedure
 - think about how to enforce a special order.
\layout Enumerate

Comment of `parent' needs to be fixed and extended.
 Check the quotes.
\layout Enumerate

Comment of `background_color' needs to be reworded.
 (To be read as <feature name> "is" <comment>)
\layout Enumerate

Comment of `foregrounf_color' needs to be reworded.
 (To be read as <feature name> "is" <comment>).
 2nd line of comment needs to be deleted.
\layout Enumerate

`is_window' should use assignment attempt and should nowhere be redefined.
\layout Enumerate

Functions that return a boolean variable with no argument should start with
 `is_'.
\layout Enumerate

Split `set_insensitive' into `enable_...' and `disable_...' or find better names.
 (Generally when there are no obvious better names (like `hide' and show')
 always use `enable_...' and `disable_...'.
\layout Enumerate

`set_x' needs better name (maybe keep `set_x' as synonym)
\layout Enumerate

`set_parent' fix postcondition.
\layout Enumerate

`width', `height', `set_width', `set_height' should explain the units used
 in their comment (In this case: Pixel).
\layout Enumerate

`set_x_y' needs better name.
\layout Enumerate

`show' and `hide' needs better comment (parent or is_window to implementation.is_
shown)
\layout Enumerate

`add_accel*', `remove_accel*' add comment that explains it deals with keyboard
 accelerators.
\layout Enumerate

Introduce notion of "Slot" instead of `add_*_command' and `remove_*_command'.
\layout Enumerate

All button commands should use new (but not yet existent mouse input device
 information abstraction).
 It should be thought about a general device information hierachy.
\layout Enumerate

Group all `add_*_command' and all `remove_*_command' in 2 feature clauses.
 (Not relevant if "slot" is beeing introduced.
\layout Enumerate

`add_leave_notify_command_ reword and check comment.
