OVERVIEW</H6>
<OL>
<LI CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId=371663">
 </A>
COM is a standard that allows software components written in different languages to communicate with each other. Unfortunately, building COM compliant applications requires the developments of huge amount of code only dedicated to support the technology. The EiffelCOM wizard was designed to free programmers from writing all the plumbing code.</LI>
<LI CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId=375227">
 </A>
The EiffelCOM wizard is a powerful tool that enables the fast development of COM components in Eiffel. It also helps accessing existing COM components from Eiffel systems. It consists of a series of dialogs which ask about the properties of a component. This information is used to produce an Eiffel system skeleton including all the code needed to access or create a component. It also produces component-specific runtime libraries. </LI>
<LI CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId=374028">
 </A>
The wizard is intended to allow Eiffel developers with little COM knowledge to develop or reuse COM components. The design of the generated code follows the Eiffel standards and should be familiar to any experienced Eiffel user. The only prerequisite to use the EiffelCOM wizard is an understanding of the Interface Definition Language. IDL is the main tool used to describe a component and can be processed by standard compilers to generate Type Libraries. They can be analyzed by tools, such as the EiffelCOM wizard, that need information on a given component. The IDL syntax is very close to C and easy to learn.</LI>
<LI CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId=369655">
 </A>
The wizard will generate code from a Type Library and additional information given by the user. This code will consist of Eiffel classes, C/C++ files, and library files. The library files are produced automatically from the generated C and C++ code. These are given for information only and you will not need to work with them to build your EiffelCOM system.</LI>

The wizard can automatically compile the generated C and Eiffel code. MIDL, the Microsoft IDL compiler, is used by the wizard to produce the Type Library corresponding to the given IDL file. You may also provide the wizard with the type library directly. For the remainder of the manual Definition File will refer to the input file given to the wizard (either an IDL file or a Type Library).</LI>

Let's focus on the wizard itself and the different questions that need to be answered to generate the code. There are five different dialogs but each session will use only four of them. The third dialog is different depending on whether the Definition File is an IDL file or a Type Library. Once the dialogs have been completed, the wizard will start analyzing the Type Library and will eventually generate the code.</LI>

<LI CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId=375318">

The main window includes a toolbar and a menu. The first three buttons on the toolbar correspond to the first three entries in the File menu: New, Open and Save. New resets all the information previously entered in the wizard. Open brings up an Open File Dialog that can be used to retrieve a previously saved EiffelCOM project. Save is used to save the current project. A project is defined by all the values entered in the wizard. A project can be saved only after the wizard has been run. The file extension for an EiffelCOM project is ewz.</LI>

If Automation is chosen then the Universal marshaller will be used (for additional information on Marshalling please see COM). If Virtual Table access is specified then you have the choice between using the Windows Universal marshaller or the marshaller generated from the definition file. Since this dialog is displayed only when the definition file is an IDL file, choosing Standard Marshalling will force the wizard to compile the marshaller from the code generated with the MIDL compiler. Standard marshalling should be used whenever some interface functions make use of non Automation compatible types (see <A HREF="com.html#25753" CLASS="XRef">

Because the definition file is a Type Library, the wizard cannot compile the Standard marshaller by itself. This is the reason for having an extra text field for the path to the marshaller (also known as Proxy/Stub pair or just Proxy/Stub). The Proxy/Stub is a Dynamic Link Library that is used to marshall the data on the wire for a given component (for additional information on Proxy/Stubs, please see <A HREF="com.html#20493" CLASS="XRef">

Component includes the code that wraps or defines the component. The Component subfolder of Server will also include the registration class. This Eiffel class includes the code needed to activate the component, its content depends on its location and will differ whether the component is in-process or out-of-process. You will not need to read or edit the C and C++ code included in CLib since the wizard will automatically compile it.

To access the component, you need to call features of the coclass. The interface functions signatures data types are either Eiffel types defined in Eiffel data structure libraries (EiffelBase) or wrappers of COM data types specified in the definition file. For example, the following IDL line</LI>

The wizard cannot generate fully specified contracts. Indeed, the tool has no domain specific knowledge and can only generate contracts that are domain independent. Such contracts, although useful, are not enough to describe entirely the behavior of the component. Generated contracts include void Eiffel objects as well as C pointer validity (for wrappers) checking. There might be other conditions to allow calls to an Eiffel coclass feature. Invariants and postconditions can be enforced in a heir of the generated Eiffel coclass. Preconditions, however, cannot be strengthened. A workaround provided by the wizard is to generate a precondition function for each feature in the interface. The default implementation of these functions always return <EM CLASS="ee-reserved">
True</EM>
. They should be redefined to implement the correct behavior:</LI>

Another advantage of the previous hierarchy is that it adds incrementality to the EiffelCOM system. Indeed, should the definition file be modified and the wizard run once more against it, your code would not be changed. Only the generated Eiffel coclass would be, and it would suffice to adapt your heir accordingly.</LI>

Another issue is the COM requirement that any interface function should return a status value (known as a HRESULT). This leads to side effect features which the Eiffel methodology tends to avoid. The workaround used in EiffelCOM systems is to map these return values into Eiffel exceptions. Should the server the EiffelCOM system is accessing return an error code, the EiffelCOM runtime will raise an Eiffel exception that your code should catch.</LI>

As a result, any feature in the coclass client making calls to the user defined Eiffel coclass should include a rescue clause. The processing done in this clause might depend on the nature of the exception. All the standard COM exceptions can be found in the library class <EM CLASS="ee-text">
ECOM_EXCEPTION_CODES</EM>
 which is inherited from by <EM CLASS="ee-text">
ECOM_EXCEPTION</EM>
. The later also inherits from the kernel class <EM CLASS="ee-text">

 and can consequently be used by the coclass client to catch the exceptions.</LI>

There are a few rules to follow when building an Eiffel coclass client but they are straightforward and do not add any constraints. The first rule consist in inheriting the generated Eiffel coclass to implement the preconditions if needed and to ensure better incrementality. The second rule applies to the client: any feature call to the Eiffel coclass should include a rescue clause.</P>

The generated Eiffel coclass features are empty features that should be redefined to implement the intended behavior. Unlike client generated code, the server generated code will differ whether you have chosen to implement an in-process or an out-of-process component. The difference lies in the component activation code in the class ECOM_&lt;Name_of_system&gt;_REGISTRATION. If the component is in-process then this class includes the four functions that need to be exported from an in-process COM component (DllRegisterServer, DllUnregisterServer, DllGetClassObject and DllCanUnloadNow). If the component is out-of-process then the registration class includes call to initialize the component and its graphical user interface (see <A HREF="wizard.html#34604" CLASS="XRef">
See Component's GUI.</A>
).</LI>

The architecture remains the same as when accessing a component: the generated Eiffel coclass should be inherited from and the contract features redefined. The default implementation for features from the generated Eiffel coclass are empty. They should also be redefined to implement the intended behavior. These features will be called by the EiffelCOM runtime whenever a client access an interface.</LI>

In the case of an out-of-process server, you might want to add a Graphical User Interface to your component. There are two different scenarios in which the component can be activated: either its user launched it explicitly (e.g. by double clicking the executable icon) or it was launched by the COM runtime to satisfy a client request. The GUI should appear only in the former case, when the application has been explicitly launched by the user. The generated registration class for an out-of-process server includes the feature:</LI>
<TABLE BORDER="1">

main_window: WEL_FRAME_WINDOW</P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<LI CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId=375570">
 </A>
This feature is a once function that can be redefined in a child class to return the class corresponding to the component window. This window is displayed only if the component is not started by COM. When COM loads an out-of-process component, it appends the option &quot;-embedding&quot; to the executable. The generated registration class looks for this option and if it is part of the process argument list then it sets the default window appearance to hidden.</LI>
<LI CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId=375583">
 </A>
As a summary, when building a server you need to implement classes that will inherit from the coclasses and implement the interfaces functions. The names of the children classes should be the names of the parent classes appended with _IMP. You will also have to inherit from the registration class in the case of an out-of-process component to provide the class that implements the component GUI.</LI>

Exceptions</H6>

The COM standard way of returning error status to the client is by returning an HRESULT from the interface function. Such behavior is not acceptable in Eiffel and is replaced with exceptions. In the case of accessing an existing component, exceptions will be raise by the EiffelCOM runtime and caught by your code (see <A HREF="wizard.html#41902" CLASS="XRef">
See Exceptions.</A>
 for details). While when creating a component it will be your code that will raise exceptions and the EiffelCOM runtime that will catch them. Here is what the code for an Eiffel coclass should look like:</LI>

This class inherits from the generated Eiffel coclass and from ECOM_EXCEPTION. It redefines the feature coclass_feature from the generated coclass. This feature is part of the interfaces functions that can be called by clients of the component. Its implementation uses the feature trigger from ECOM_EXCEPTION to raise exceptions in case the feature cannot be executed normally (invalid argument e.g.). This exception will be catch by the EiffelCOM runtime and mapped into an HRESULT that will be sent back to the client.</LI>

Implementing an EiffelCOM components consists in inheriting from the generated Eiffel coclasses and implementing their features. The only specific rules to follow relate to the redefinition of precondition features and the use of exceptions to return error status to the client. In the case of an out-of-process server, the registration class should be inherited from and the feature corresponding to the component window redefined to return the correct class.</LI>
