test_name 	assign-attempt-exp-to-ref
test_description A routine has an assignment attempt whose source is of type expanded FOO and whose target is of type FOO.  When executed, the assignment attempt correctly succeeds.  However, after wasting some memory and presumably causing garbage collection, system execution ends with a segmentation fault.  The generated C code appears to be incorrect.
