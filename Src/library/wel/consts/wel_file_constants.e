feature -- Access

	generic_read: INTEGER = 0x80000000
			-- Read access

	generic_write: INTEGER = 0x40000000
			-- Write access			

	generic_execute: INTEGER = 0x20000000
			-- Execute access

	generic_all: INTEGER = 0x10000000
			-- Read/write/execute access

feature -- CreateFile

	create_new: INTEGER = 1
			-- Creates a new file. The function fails if the specified file already exists

	create_always: INTEGER = 2
			-- Creates a new file. If the file exists, the function overwrites the file,
			-- clears the existing attributes, combines the specified file attributes
			-- and flags with FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE, but does not set the security
			-- descriptor specified by the SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure

	open_existing: INTEGER = 3
			-- Opens the file. The function fails if the file does not exist.
			-- For a discussion of why you should use OPEN_EXISTING for devices, see Remarks.

	open_always: INTEGER = 4
			-- Opens the file, if it exists. If the file does not exist, the function
			-- creates the file as if dwCreationDisposition were CREATE_NEW

	truncate_existing: INTEGER = 5
			-- Opens the file and truncates it so that its size is zero bytes.
			-- The calling process must open the file with the GENERIC_WRITE access right.
			-- The function fails if the file does not exist.

feature -- Attributes

	file_attribute_normal: INTEGER = 0x00000080
			-- The file has no other attributes set. This attribute is valid only if used alone.

	file_attribute_temporary: INTEGER = 0x100
			-- The file is being used for temporary storage. File systems avoid writing
			-- data back to mass storage if sufficient cache memory is available, because
			-- often the application deletes the temporary file shortly after the handle
			-- is closed. In that case, the system can entirely avoid writing the data.
			-- Otherwise, the data will be written after the handle is closed.

feature -- Share mode

	file_share_read: INTEGER = 0x00000001
			-- Enables subsequent open operations on the object to request read access.
			-- Otherwise, other processes cannot open the object if they request read access.
			--
			-- If the object has already been opened with read access, the sharing mode must
			-- include this flag.

	file_share_write: INTEGER = 0x00000002
			-- Enables subsequent open operations on the object to request write access.
			-- Otherwise, other processes cannot open the object if they request write access.
			--
			-- If the object has already been opened with write access, the sharing mode
			-- must include this flag.

	file_flag_write_through: INTEGER = 0x80000000

	File_flag_no_buffering: INTEGER = 0x20000000

feature -- Position

	file_begin: INTEGER = 0
	file_current: INTEGER = 1
	file_end: INTEGER = 2;
			-- Position in file where to set pointer
