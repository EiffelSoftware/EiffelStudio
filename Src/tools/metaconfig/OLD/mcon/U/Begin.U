?X: This file comes after option processing had been done and after all
?X: the default values have been set up. It marks the beginning of questions.
?X: It is important that Options be listed *after* Myinit to ensure that the
?X: default initializations performed by Init and Myinit will not clobber
?X: any setting done on the command line via -D or -U.

?X: This is run only when within the UU directory, hence we can safely

trap 'echo " "; test -d ../UU && rm -rf X $rmlist; exit 1' 1 2 3 15
