A system has a call whose target is of an expanded type `expanded
FOO', where class FOO is not declared as an expanded class.  The call
is to a function whose return type is `like Current'.  Melting the
system works fine but when the system is executed it dies with a
segmentation fault.  Frozen code works fine.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
