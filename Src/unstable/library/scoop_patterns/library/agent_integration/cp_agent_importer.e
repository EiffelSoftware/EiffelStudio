		"[
		Importer for agent objects.
		
		Note: Due to the use of reflection, the agent has tu fulfill 
		some requiremets:

		1)  Every closed argument has to be either truly separate or a basic
			expanded type. It is NOT sufficient to just declare the argument
			as separate, as this cannot	be checked due to a runtime limitation.

		2)  The target must be open. A target always has to be non-separate,
			and we can't import arbitrary reference objects.

		3)  There must not be any leftovers from a previous call,
			i.e. `operands' and {FUNCTION}.last_result must be Void.
		
		The creation procedure `make_unsafe' does not check rule (1). If you 
		use it, make sure that every closed argument is declared as separate.
