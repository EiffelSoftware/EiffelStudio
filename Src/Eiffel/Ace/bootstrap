# Script to perform manually a 3 stage bootstrap which goal is to have a new compiler
# compiled with the new code generation and test it on itself.
#  stage 1: ec generates ec_stage1 that will generate code with new code generation
#  stage 2: ec_stage1 generates ec_stage2 that is generated with new code generation
#           and that will generate code with new code generation.
#  stage 3: verification `ec_stage3' and `ec_stage2' should be identical, but time
#           used to build ec_stage2 should be different from time to build ec_stage3.
#           Usually it should be shorter to generate ec_stage3, in which case we have
#           improved the performance of the compiler.
