		 The COM standard allows software components written in different languages to
		 communicate with each other. Unfortunately, building COM compliant applications
		 requires the development of large amount of code only dedicated to support the
		 technology. The EiffelCOM wizard was designed to free programmers from writing
		 the plumbing code.

		 The EiffelCOM wizard is a powerful tool that enables the fast development of
		COM components in Eiffel and access COM components from Eiffel systems. It
		consists of a series of dialogs, which ask about the component’s
		characteristics. The wizard needs the data to produce an Eiffel system skeleton,
		the code to access or create a component, and the component-specific runtime
		libraries.

		The wizard allows Eiffel developers with little COM
		knowledge to develop and reuse COM components. The design of the generated code
		follows the Eiffel standards and is familiar experienced Eiffel users. The only
		prerequisite to use the EiffelCOM wizard is an understanding of the <i>Interface
		Definition Language</i>. <i>IDL</i> describes a component. Standard compilers
		can generate <i>Type Libraries</i> from <i>IDL</i> files. Tools that need
		information on a given component, such as the EiffelCOM wizard, Visual Basic,
		etc. analyze Type Libraries. The <i>IDL</i> syntax is very close to C and easy
		to learn.

		 The wizard generates code from a Type Library and additional information given
		 by the user. The generated code consists of Eiffel classes, C/C++ files, and
		 library files. The wizard automatically produces library files from generated C
		 and C++ code. You do not need to modify generated C/C++ code to build your
		 EiffelCOM system.

		 The wizard automatically compiles the generated C
		 and Eiffel code. To produce a Type Library corresponding to a given IDL file
		 the wizard uses <i>MIDL</i>, the MICROSOFT IDL compiler. You may also provide
		 the wizard with a Type Library directly. For the rest of the manual a<i> COM
		 Definition File</i> will refer to the input file given to the wizard (either an
		 IDL file or a Type Library). If you want to start from an existing Eiffel
		 system, the wizard accepts an Eiffel class and generates an IDL file from it
		 and then proceeds as above.
