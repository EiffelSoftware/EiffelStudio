				1 - Launch the Resource Bench application. This small dialog box will appear for the initialization process:
				<paragraph>
					<image><url>/images/resource_bench/retriev.png</url></image>
				</paragraph>
				Then you get the main window of Resource Bench:
				<paragraph>
					<image><url>/images/resource_bench/rb.png</url></image>
				</paragraph>
			</paragraph>

			<paragraph>
				2 - Open a resource file (why not the example.rc file provided with this release of Resource Bench). Let the application parse the file. You will see a dialog box that informs you of the parsing's state. 
				<line_break />
				First, there is the preprocessing of the resource file:
				<paragraph>
					<image><url>/images/resource_bench/prepro.png</url></image>
				</paragraph>
				Then you have the analysis phase:
				<paragraph>
					<image><url>/images/resource_bench/analyz.png</url></image>
				</paragraph>
			</paragraph>

			<paragraph>
				3 - After these two steps you will see a hierarchical view of the resource file that show you what resource's type are included in the resource file (Below the result of the &quot;example.rc&quot; file).
				<paragraph>
					<image><url>/images/resource_bench/collaps.png</url></image>
				</paragraph>
				You can expand the tree view to see associated resources for each resource's type.
				<paragraph>

				</paragraph>
				
				At this point you are able to:
				<list ordered="false">
					<item>Select some properties for the Eiffel code generation</item>
					<item>Save a project file</item>
					<item>Generate Eiffel Code</item>
					<item>Regenerate the same resource file (the third point is very useful when you have a Resource Bench Project and do not have the original resource file that permits its creation).</item>
				</list>
			</paragraph>

			<paragraph>
				4 - To save a project file, click on the save button of the toolbar or select the save item in the file menu. A standard save dialog box will appear in which you can specify the file name of your project. The file's extension for a Resource Bench project is &quot;*.prb&quot;
			</paragraph>
							
			<paragraph>
				5 - To generate Eiffel Code, select the &quot;Generate Eiffel Code...&quot; item in the Build menu, this dialog box will appear to ask you in which directory Resource Bench must save the Eiffel classes:
				<paragraph>
					<image><url>/images/resource_bench/browse.png</url></image>
				</paragraph>
			</paragraph>
				
			<paragraph>
				6 - To generate a resource file, select the &quot;Generate Resource file...&quot; item in the Build menu, a standard save dialog box will appear to save the file.
