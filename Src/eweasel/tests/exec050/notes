A class inherits three deferred features and joins and effects them.
The flatshort form of the heir class looks as expected, with all
alternative preconditions present in the expected order.  But when the
system is executed, only one of the preconditions of the deferred
features is executed.  In this case, postconditions seem to work correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
