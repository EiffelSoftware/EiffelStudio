A class with an external feature which is a procedure and which
includes a signature that specifies a return type should be called a
syntax error (or validity error), but the compiler accepts it.  When
the system is frozen, the generated C code won't compile since a void
function cannot return a value.

Discovered in Release 3.3 beta.
