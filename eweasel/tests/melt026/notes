A class repeated creates a manifest array whose elements are an
expanded type.  If the routine which does this creation the array and
the elements are all melted and there are four or more elements in the
manifest array, a segmentation fault occurs when the system is
executed.  Frozen code works fine.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
