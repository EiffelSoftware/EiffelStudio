After initial compilation where the system is frozen, but without C
code compilation, an inheritance clause is removed, which removes a
class from the system.  Changes are melted.  When system cannot be
executed (because C code wasn't compiled), an attempt is made to
compile the C code.  However, it won't link due to an undefined
symbol.

Discovered in release 5.4.0610.
