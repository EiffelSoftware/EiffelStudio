Preferences window overview</h1>
The preferences dialog window is divided in three parts (plus a button
bar at the bottom).
<p>SCREENSHOT (preference window)
<p>The left part is used to display a tree that displays preferences categories.
A description of the content of this tree, i.e. the different categories
of preferences and preferences themselves, is available <a href="/reference/85_preferences/20_preferences_reference/index.html">here</a>.
<p>The upper right part shows the preferences attached to the currently
selectly tree node. They appears in a table that has two colums. The first
one contains the description of the preference, the second one contains
its value. To modify this value, select the preference by clicking on it.
The lower right part will then be update to allow the change.
<p>What will be displayed in this part depends on the type of the preference.
There are four of them :
<ul>
<li>
Boolean preferences : their possible values are "True" or "False". A combo-box
will allow you to choose one or the other.</li>

<li>
Color preferences : Their value is represented by three integers, which
are the RGB code of the color. You do not have to use RGB codes though.
When you select such a preference, the current color and two buttons are
displayed in the lower right part. If you press the first button, a color
selection window will appear. For some background color, you have the possibility
to click on the "Auto" button. [BENCH] will then set the current color
to the default background color.</li>

<li>
Font preferences : A font selection window will appear as you press the
button with label "change".</li>

<li>
Other preferences : They will be modified by using a text field in the
lower right part.</li>
</ul>
If there is no message stating you need to restart [BENCH] (next to the
preference description in the lower right part), changes will be taken
into account immediately.

<p CLASS="warning"><b>Caution</b>: Sub-categories and their content are
not displayed in the upper right area. To see the preferences that belong
to a sub-category, you have to select it in the left part of the window.

<p CLASS="warning"><b>Caution</b>: You can restore preferences default
values by clicking on the "Restore Default" button. ALL preferences will
be reset.
