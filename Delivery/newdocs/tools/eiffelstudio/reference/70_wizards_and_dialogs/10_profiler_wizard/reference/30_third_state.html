<h1>Select a Run-time information record to generate the Execution Profile</h1>
<p>The third screen of the wizard lets you generate an <i>Execution Profile</i> 
from a <i>Run-time information
record</i>. You should provide the <i> Run-time information record</i> produced by the
profiler in the text field labeled <b> Run-time information record</b>. If the file
provided by default is not the desired one change it by clicking on the <b> Browse</b>
button or by directly entering it in the text field.&nbsp;
</p>

<p> Then, in the combo box labeled <b>Profiler used to produce the above
record</b>, select the profiler
that has been used to produce the <i> Run-time information record</i> you have
entered. If the profiler used to execute the system does not appear in the
combo box, you have to add it. See <a href="../how_to_s/10_setup_profiler_configuration_file.html">How to set up a Profiler Configuration File</a>
for more details on how to do so.
</p>

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: <i> The Run-time information record</i> has to be located in the <i>EIFGEN\W_code</i> directory of
your project.
</p>

Clicking <b> Next</b> will lead you to the <a href="40_final_state.html"> Final state</a> if the provided
<i> Run-time information record</i> is valid.
If the <i> Run-time information record</i> is not valid or is not located in the
<i>EIFGEN\W_code</i> directory of the project, you will
go to the <b> Run-time Information Record Error state</b> as shown below.
