A system with an invalid generic derivation of a generic class with
two formal generic parameters A and B, where B is constrained by `LIST
[A]' is accepted by the compiler, but should not be.  This results in
an undetected type error and a segmentation fault when the system is
executed.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
