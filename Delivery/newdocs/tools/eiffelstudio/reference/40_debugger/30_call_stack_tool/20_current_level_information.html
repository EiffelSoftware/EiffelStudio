<h1>Information relative to a stack element</h1>
<p>In addition to the <A HREF="10_call_stack_tool.html">call stack tool</A> that provides
 information concerning the call stack in its
globality, some other debug tools give information concerning the <A HREF="10_call_stack_tool.html">current call
stack element</a>.<p>In debug mode, the context tool is automatically switched
to the feature view in flat form, and displays the feature which corresponds to
the current call stack element. In the left margin, a yellow arrow ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbench/icon_bpslot_top.gif"> ) marks the
execution line where the program is currently stopped, whereas a green arrow ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbench/icon_bpslot_stopped.gif"> )
indicates the execution line that was attained in the feature in the current
call stack element. Therefore, if a feature is recursive, and appears several
times in the call stack, changing the current call stack element may cause green
arrows to be displayed at different places in the same feature (if the different
did not reach the same execution point). On the other hand, the yellow arrow can
only appear at one place as long as the application is not started again.
<p>The <a HREF="../40_object_tool/15_local_view.html">left part of the object tool</a>
gives valuable information concerning parameters that were passed to the feature
corresponding to the current call stack, the current value of the local
variables, and, if it is a function, the current value of its result.</p>
