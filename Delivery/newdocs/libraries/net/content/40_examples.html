		<H1>Introduction to the examples</H1>
        <p>The following sections describe a set of examples showing how to use
        EiffelNet to build client-server applications.</p>
        <p>The examples start with the most simple uses involving high-level
        classes covering common cases and shielding developers from details of
        the mechanism. Subsequent examples will reveal some of these details,
        useful for more advanced or specific applications of EiffelNet.</p>
        <p>All the examples discussed here appear in the directory <i><b>$ISE_EIFFEL/examples/net</b></i>
        of the Eiffel distribution.</p>
        <p>Caution: On Windows, the `advanced' and the `same_mach' are not
        working since they are using specific code to Unix Operating systems.</p>
