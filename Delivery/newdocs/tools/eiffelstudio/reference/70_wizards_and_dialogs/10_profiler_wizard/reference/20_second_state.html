<h1>Reuse or Generate an Execution Profile</h1>
<p>The second screen of the wizard enables you to reuse a previously generated <i> Execution Profile</i> or
to generate a new <i> Execution Profile</i> from a <i> Run-time information
record</i>.
</p>

<p>The profiler wizard has detected that one or more <i> Execution Profiles</i> 
have
already been generated for this system in this compilation mode. If you have
executed your system after the generation of the existing profile, select <b>Generate
a profile from Run-time information record</b> to create a new <i> Execution Profile</i>
for the newly produced <i> Run-time information record</i>.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you choose <b>Generate
a profile from Run-time information record</b> the generated <i> Execution Profile</i>
will be written into <i>&lt;project_directory&gt;/EIFGEN/W_CODE/profinfo.pfi</i>
if you have selected <b>Workbench mode</b> in the first step, or<i> </i><i>&lt;project_directory&gt;/EIFGEN/W_CODE/profinfo.pfi</i>
if you have selected <b>Finalized mode</b>. If a file with the same name already
exists its content will be destroyed and replaced.</p><br>
<p>
However if you have not executed your system since the generation of the last <i> 
Execution Profile</i>, there is no need to generate a new <i> Execution Profile</i>. If you are in the latter case,
select <b>Use existing profile</b> and choose the last <i> Execution Profile</i> you
have generated.
</p>
<p class="tip"><b>Tip</b>: If you want to archive different <i> Execution Profiles</i> (to compare
them for example), rename the <i> profinfo.pfi</i> file into a new name but keep the .pfi
extension. The profiler wizard detects existing Execution Profiles by checking
the file extensions.</p>

Clicking <b> Next</b> will lead you to the <a href="30_third_state.html"> Third state</a> if you have selected <b>Generate
a profile from Run-time information record</b>. On the other hand if you have
selected <b>Use existing profile</b> you will go to the <a href="40_final_state.html"> Final
