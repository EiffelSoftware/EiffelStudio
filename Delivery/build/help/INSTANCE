Command instances
-----------------

Before you can derive an actual command from a command type
you need to instantiate it, and usually to give it one or
more arguments. This is exactly like an Eiffel class, which
will give an object only if you execute a creation instruction
such as

 !! x.make (a, b, ...)

Now you have a real command. You can drag-and-drop the instantiated
command into the corresponding hole of the `Behavior'-format of
the Context tool, to define an association between an event and
a command for a certain context.
