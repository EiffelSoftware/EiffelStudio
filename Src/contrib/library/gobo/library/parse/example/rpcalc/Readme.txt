This directory contains the source code for the reverse polish notation
calculator used as an example in Geyacc documentation.
Please refer to $GOBO/doc/geyacc/examples.html for details.

To compile this example:

1. Use the script 'geant parser' to generate class RPCALC if necessary.

2. Use your favorite Eiffel compiler to compile the Eiffel system using
   the provided Ace, Xace or ECF file (e.g. <compiler>.ecf). Alternatively
   you can use 'geant' to launch the compilation:
   
       geant compile_<compiler>
       
   where <compiler> is either 'ise' or 'ge'.

3. Run the calcultor:

       rpcalc

   and enter reverse polish notation expressions to be evaluated, one
   per line.
