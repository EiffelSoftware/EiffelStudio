# Goal:
	ecf_tool groups a collection of tools related to ecf manipulation.
	For now, there are 3 commands:
	- updater: that enable to update ecf locations values according to various criteria
	- integration: scan a folder recursively, and generate an integration ecf, i.e an ecf that includes all found .ecf files, and make it possible to compile all at once.
	- resave: resave an ecf using the ecf printer and latest ecf schema.

# Usage:

	ecf_tool help
	ecf_tool updater --help
	ecf_tool integration --help
	ecf_tool resave --help
