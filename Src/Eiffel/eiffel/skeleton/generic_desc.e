				-- For example:
				-- 1) In generic derivation for ARRAY [expanded X [ANY]], the `area'
				--    attribute should be created as SPECIAL [G], not as SPECIAL [expanded X [ANY]]
				--    which is incorrect. See eweasel test#storable013 which shows that if things
				--    are not done properly here it fails.
				-- 2) In a class, we have `like Current' and if `like Current' is now part of
				--    an expanded class, then we still need to remember that we create a `like Current'
				--    and not the expanded type we get from `skeleton_adapted_in'.

				-- class type. Note that {EXPANDED_DESC}.instantiation_in uses `adapted_in' and
				-- not `skeleton_adapted_in' but at this stage I don't have a good explanation
				-- just the fact that `skeleton_adapted_in' is just for backward compatibility
				-- for storable on `type_i' but `cl_type_i' is only used for checking VLEC, not
				-- for code generation, so using `adapted_in' seems more correct.
