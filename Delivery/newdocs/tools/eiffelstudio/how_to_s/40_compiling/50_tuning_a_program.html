		<H1>Tuning a program</H1>
        <p>The best way to speed up a program is of course to improve the
        algorithms and data structures you are using. Spotting the functions
        that slow down the execution and improving can change a lot in a
        program. HYPERLINK(debugging/Profiling) Profiling can be used for this.</p>
        <p>Try to keep the number of classes and objects in your system as low
        as possible to ensure maximum efficiency. This should never hinder
        the design of the system, though.</p>
        <p>You can also use the functionalities provided by the HYPERLINK(MEMORY
        class) MEMORY class to tweak the garbage collector behavior according to
        your needs. However, be careful with this, since providing erroneous
        parameters might lead to memory leaks, huge memory consumption, or on
        the contrary a dramatic slow down of the application. If you are not
        entirely sure what a parameter is for, avoid changing it. The default
        values should fit for most standard applications.</p>

        <p>Besides, EiffelStudio provides powerful optimizations, some being
        done automatically, other being configurable. To have a maximum
        efficiency, it is recommended to <A HREF="10_generating_executables.html">Finalize</a>
        your program from scratch and
        without using precompiled libraries.</p>

        <p>In the <a href="HYPERLINK(reference_project_settings)">System Settings</A> 
        dialog, try experimenting the <b>Inlining</b> option, and setting the
        maximum size of features that should be inlined. Only Eiffel features
        are inlined by this option, to see how to inline the C functions you may
        be using in your program, please refer to your C documentation.</p>

        <p>In the <a href="HYPERLINK(reference_project_settings)">System Settings</A> 
        dialog, enabling the <b>Dead code removal</b> will help produce smaller
        executables.</p>

        <p>Removing the <b>Execution Trace</b> will slightly optimize the
        executable in size and speed, but in case of crash no information will
        be available.</p>

        <p>You can also enable the <b>Array optimization</b> option to slightly
        speed up array access.</p>

        <p>All these options are located in the <a href="HYPERLINK(reference_project_settings)">System Settings</A> 
        dialog, under the <b>Advanced</b> tab. They are only effective during
        finalizations.</p>
