/* We need to define _ALLOW_MSC_VER_MISMATCH on Windows because if we don't we get a linker
 * error if the linker is a different version from the one used to compile the runtime. This
 * only happens when the C++ code we compile use some standard libraries.
 *
 * Because all our C++ code is only being used inside the runtime (no exchange with the
 * outside world) and because our testing via eweasel shows this to work, we define
 * the following macro to prevent the linker for raising a version mismatch.
