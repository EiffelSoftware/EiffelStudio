Types of Components</h2>

ActiveX, DirectX, OCX, COM+, ADO+, ASP etc. who never heard of these 
technologies? They all represent yet another use of the COM standard. 
This paragraph will focus on categorizing COM components according to 
their own properties as well as the context in which they are used. 
The categorization will define how the EiffelCOM wizard should be 
used to wrap or create a component.

The first criteria that defines the type of component is from where 
it will be accessed: will the component be loaded in the client process 
or will the component be a remote server for a distributed application? 
In the former case, the component is compiled as a Dynamic Link Libraries 
(DLL) while in the latter case it is a standard executable.

In-process Components</h2>

<A NAME="pgfId=374078">
 </A>
Typical instances of DLL components are found in technologies such as 
OCX, ActiveX, or ASP. These are small, downloadable binaries that will 
be loaded and executed in a container. The container acts as a client 
of the component. The EiffelCOM wizard provides the ability to wrap 
such components by providing access to its interface to any Eiffel 
container. It is also possible to create a new In-process component 
in Eiffel. 
<p>
One main difference with out-of-process components (other 
than the nature of the module, DLL versus executable) is the way 
in-process components are activated. In the case of out-of-process 
components, the component will specify COM when it is ready to 
receive calls from client. In the case of an in-process server the 
call is coming directly from COM: COM first loads the DLL into the 
client process and then calls the exported function DllGetClassObject 
to access the component class object. The other three exported 
functions of an in-process component are DllRegister to register 
the component in the Windows registry, DllUnregister to unregister 
the component from the registry and finally DllCanUnloadNow which 
gets called by COM whenever it tries to unload the component from 
memory. These four functions must be accessible from outside the 
DLL for the in-process component to work properly.

Out-of-process Components</h2>

<A NAME="pgfId=374091">

These components are standard executable acting as servers that 
can be accessed locally or over a network. Typically used in a 
three tier client server architecture, the major difference with 
in-process servers (other than the module type - executable 
instead of DLL) is their lifetime. In-process components are 
typically loaded to achieve a specific task and unloaded just 
after while out-of-process components are servers supposed to 
run continuously. The EiffelCOM wizard allows to build clients 
for such servers in Eiffel. It also provides the ability to create 
such servers.
