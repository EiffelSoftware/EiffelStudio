A class has pattern of creation of small STRINGs guided by a random
number generator.  It also has an attribute which is a BIT_REF and it
calls deep_clone on the current object after each STRING creation.
The system compiles fine with `assertion (all)', but violates
postcondition `deep_equal' of routine `deep_clone' when it is
executed.

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
