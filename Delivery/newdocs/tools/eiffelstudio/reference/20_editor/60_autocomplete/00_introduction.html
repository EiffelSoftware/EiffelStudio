		<P>[BENCH] editor includes new features which were designed to help writing Eiffel code. Automatic
		completion is one of those. This feature is available in two contexts:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>when the user types some expressions defined in the Eiffel language.
			<LI>when the user enters a feature call.
		</UL>
		<P>As, regarding auto-complete, expectations vary from one individual to another, this feature is highly
		customizable and can be disabled.
