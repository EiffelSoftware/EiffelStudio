		<paragraph>The EiffelBuild preferences are used to handle all user defined preferences.

To access all of the available EiffelBuild preferences, you may use the Preferences dialog, accessible from the "View", "Preferences", "Preferences..." menu option. The preference dialog has the following appearance:</paragraph>
