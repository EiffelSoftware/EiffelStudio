Possible new tools for ISE Eiffel.

1) Memory profiler
Displays a graphical view of the memory, gives memory fragmentation, free space, allocated memory, unreferenced objects, lists references to one object, finds classes that are the most instantiated, the biggest objects, GC stats, etc.

2) Test wizard
Automatically generates code that instantiates classes and randomly calls one or more features, to check that the features' contracts are verified.

3) DLL debugger
Make it possible to debug a DLL generated by EiffelStudio.

4) Graphical tester
A tool that sends random mouse/key actions to a debugged executable (or to a part of a debugged executable) to test it. Must let the user record action sequences to design automated graphic tests.
