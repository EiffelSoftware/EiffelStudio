After initial compilation an inherited variable attribute in a
grandparent is changed to a constant attribute, thereby introducing a
VDRS(2) violation.  But when the constant attribute is changed back to
a variable attribute, the compiler still reports a VDRS(2) error
though none is present.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
