		<H1>Creating a new project</H1>
        <p>The first thing to do to start Eiffeling is to create a project. Most
        commands are disabled when no project is created.</p>
        <p>When opening EiffelStudio, by default a dialog is popped up that
        proposes to create or open a project:</p>
        <p align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/dialogs_and_wizards/startup_dialog.png"></p>
        <p>Under <b>Create a new project</b>, several options are
        offered, which depend on the package of EiffelStudio you have and on the
        platform you are on.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>Basic application</b> is the most basic new
            project that can be generated. It only includes the 
            <A HREF="/libraries/base/reference/introduction.html">base library</A> and
            by default only creates the frame of the project. This is the ideal choice to start
            a textual (console) application, or to discover Eiffel. Indeed, the
            project is very light and includes only things that are essential in
            any project. It is available on all platforms.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>.NET application</b> has by default all essential
            components to start a project targetting the Microsoft .NET
            platform. Of course, it is only available on Windows.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>Vision2 application</b> creates a new project
            that includes the <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/introduction.html">EiffelVision2 library</A>. This is the
            perfect choice to start a platform-independent graphic application, or even any
            graphic application, since EiffelVision2 is easier to use than
            platform-specific libraries. This option is available on all
            platforms and all packages.</li>
          <li>
            <p align="left"><b>WEL application</b> generates a project using the
            <A HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/introduction.html">Windows Eiffel Library (WEL)</A>. This option is recommended for
            projects needing advanced Windows features, or Windows applications
            that are time-critical, since the graphic functionality provided
            by WEL is more efficient than the one provided by Vision2, which on
            the other hand provides a platform-independent abstract interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="left">All those options are also available in the <b>File</b>/<b>New
        project...</b> menu. This pops up a dialog with all the options to generate
        a new project:
        <p align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/dialogs_and_wizards/create_a_project.png">
        <p class="tip"><b>Tip</b>: If you checked the &quot;Don't
        show this dialog at startup&quot; checkbox in the start-up dialog but want to get it back, you
        can use the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/85_preferences/20_preferences_reference/30_graphical_elements/20_discardable_dialogs.html">Preferences dialog</A> to reset the default value.</P>
