Validity: Call Sharing Rule (VMCS)

     It is valid for a feature f repeatedly inherited by 
     a class D from an ancestor A, such that f is shared
     under repeated inheritance and not redeclared, to 
     involve a feature g of A other than as the feature 
     of a qualified call if and only if g is, along the 
     corresponding inheritance paths, also shared.
