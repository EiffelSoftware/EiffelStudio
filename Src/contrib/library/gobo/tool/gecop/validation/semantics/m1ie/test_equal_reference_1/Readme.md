# Semantics M1IE

This [test](.) is exercising the semantics rule [`M1IE`](../Readme.md).

### Description

In this test, we have an inequality expression of the form `c /= d` where `c` and `d` are attached to two different objects of type `STRING` with the same characters `"gobo"`. The value of this expression is true because the objects are with reference semantics.
