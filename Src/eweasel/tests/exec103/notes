A non-expanded class FOO has a routine `bar' which passes Current to a
routine which uses it to set an attribute in the object referenced by
the passed argument.  Another class declares an entity of type
`expanded FOO' and calls `bar' on it.  The attribute in this entity is
changed by the call, though it should not be.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
