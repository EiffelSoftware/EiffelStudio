<h1>Set slice size command</h1>
<p>

Located in the object tool toolbar, this command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_slice_limits_vsmall_color.gif">
changes the display size of special
objects (ie objects whose class inherits from <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/base/reference/kernel/special.html">SPECIAL</a>).
Since special objects may contain thousands of attributes, only the 50 first are
displayed by default. If left-clicked, a dialog is popped up that sets the
exploration indices of special objects that will be loaded in the future.<p>This
dialog changes the settings for future special objects:<p>SCREENSHOT(dialog box
set slice, global)<p>If a special object is
<A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">dropped</a>
onto this command, the special object that is dropped is shrunk or extended in
the tree according to the new exploration indices it is given in the dialog box.
The dropped object may be any object, top-level or not.<p>This dialog changes
the settings for a single special object:<p>SCREENSHOT(dialog box set slice,
relative to an object)
