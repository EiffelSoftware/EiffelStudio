After initial compilation, the name of an attribute in an inherited
class is changed, thereby introducing a VHRC violation.  The compiler
detects the violation, but when it is removed by deleting both the
attribute and the rename clause in the heir and compilation is
resumed, the compiler dies with an exception trace.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
