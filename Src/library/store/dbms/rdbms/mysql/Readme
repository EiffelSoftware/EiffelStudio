The MYSQL class is the database specification file. 
An instance of this class is used as generic parameter in EiffelStore.


On Windows
----------
You need to have $(MYSQL) in your environment, set to the directory where the MySQL C Connector is installed.
(i.e, directory containing the mysql "include" folder).

On Linux
--------
Either you install libmysqlclient-dev or libmariadb-dev packages
For instance on debian:
	apt install libmysqlclient-dev
	(or apt install libmariadb-dev)

Or, you can also use a custom installation and set in your environment:
 - $(MYSQLINC) set to the directory where mysql.h is located.
 - $(MYSQLLIB) set to the directory where libmysqlclient.a is location.

For instance, on debian:
- To install the needed MySQL packages:
	apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
	(or apt-get install libmariadb-dev)

- Note that if mysql_config (or mariadb_config) is not available you should set your environment:
	export MYSQLINC=/usr/include/mysql
	export MYSQLLIB=/usr/lib/mysql
	export MYSQLLIB=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu
  Check your system for the exact locations.

Note: If you use an old libmysqlclient (before MySQL 5.5, back at the end of 2009), you may need to
edit the .ecf, to use libmysqlclient_r instead of libmysqlclient in multi-threaded applications.
