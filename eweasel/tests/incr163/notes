After initial compilation, formal generics in an inheritance clause
are switched, causing a class to no longer conform to the generic
constraint.  The class is used as an actual generic in a generic
constraint.  The compiler does not detect the newly introduced VTCG
error.

Discovered in Release 5.0.015.
