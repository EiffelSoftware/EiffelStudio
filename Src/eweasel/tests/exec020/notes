A system which seems to be correct concatenates and prints the BIT
constants of a manifest array many times, but eventually dies with a
run-time panic.  Also, the values printed are incorrect (all zeroes).
Modifying the concatenation routine (causing melting) and re-executing
the system yields correct output, but the panic still occurs.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.05.17.
