Instructions to build a delivery:

1 - Preparing a delivery:

Make sure that ISE_EIFFEL and ISE_PLATFORM are correctly defined, ie
they point to an existing Eiffel installation.

Edit `set_aliases' to reflect your environment.

Launch `make_delivery' from the Delivery/scripts/unix directory as otherwise
it won't work.


2 - Producing a library for a given platform:

Launch `compile_exes $ISE_PALTFORM' where $ISE_PLATFORM is the value for
your platform.

Then `make_images $ISE_PLATFORM'.

At the end you have an ISO.gz and a tgz package of your delivery in the directory
where the 2 above scripts where launched.
