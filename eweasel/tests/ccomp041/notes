A generic class `TEST1 [G -> ANY create default_create end]' declares
a local of y: G and then does `create y'.  A client class declares a
local of type `TEST1 [DOUBLE]'.  The system compiles fine when frozen,
but the generated C code won't compile.  Melted code works fine.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
