Error code: VTGC(2)

Error: An error occurred in the renaming clause of a formal generic.
What to do:
  In the case of a multi-constraint generic (like in  'G -> {A,B}')
  one has to ensure that for every used feature there are no ambiguities.
  In order to achieve that goal you can use a renaming clause.
  For example: G -> {A rename f as g end, B}
Hint: The renaming for formal generics is analogous to the
  renaming occurring during inheritance.

Class: BB [G -> {TUPLE [x: INTEGER_32] rename x as y end, ANY}]
Renaming of constraint class: TUPLE
  at position #1  of formal G
The following features do not occur in the base class and therefore cannot be renamed:
   `x'
