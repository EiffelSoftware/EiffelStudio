test_name 	ensure-extend-linked-list
test_description After initial melting of a root class whose creation procedure has an empty body, a local of type LINKED_LIST [STRING] is added and the routine body is modified to create the linked list and extend it with one string.  The assertion level is `ensure'.  When the system is recompiled and executed, system execution ends with a segmentation fault in `go_to' of LINKED_LIST.
