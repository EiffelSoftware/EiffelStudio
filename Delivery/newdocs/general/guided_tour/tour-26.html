<H2 CLASS="aa-sec3">
<A NAME="pgfId-439084"></A>Cleaning up</H2>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-439085"></A>Since you were treacherously led to introduce a validity error in the previous section, you must first make sure it is removed. The simplest way is to remove the argument to <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
first_message</SPAN>
 in the last line of procedure <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
display </SPAN>
in class <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
INVALID </SPAN>
so that the line just reads: 
<p><ul><table bgcolor="#cfffcf" width="79%" BORDER="1">
<TR>
<TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
<P CLASS="ee-text">
<A NAME="pgfId-439091"></A><SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
p.first_message</SPAN>

</TD>
</TR>
</table></ul><p>
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-439092"></A>(Alternatively, you can change the declaration of <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
invalid </SPAN>
in <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
TESTROOT </SPAN>
back to its original comment form.) Save and melt again.
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="aa-sec3">
<A NAME="pgfId-439096"></A>Running a system</H2>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-439103"></A>To run the system click the Run button on the right border of the Project Tool. As you will have noted from looking at the class texts, all that the example system does is to print a few messages:
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-439111"></A>Where does the output appear? On Windows, as soon as your system produces its first output (if any), a console window appears, as shown above. All standard output will go there; this is also where your system's users will enter input if the system reads from standard input. At the end of execution, EiffelStudio outputs <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Press Return to finish the execution </SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="S">
&#8230; </SPAN>
The reason for this convention is easy to understand: you don't want the console to go away immediately at the end of the execution (after flashing the output so quickly that you won't have had the time to see it!); but you don't necessarily want the console to stay up forever, especially if you start several executions, each sprouting its own console. If you don't do anything, the console will remain, so that you can for example compare the output of several executions. To get rid of a console, just do as the message suggests: hit Return in the console. Do this now.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-439118"></A>On Unix and VMS the matter is simpler: you have started EiffelStudio from a certain window, by typing the command <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
ebench</SPAN>
; that window is where the standard output will go, and where the execution will read from standard input. You can also redirect the standard input and output using the standard operating system mechanisms.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-439119"></A>On any platform, you may re-execute the system as many times as you wish by clicking on Run again.
</DIV>
<DIV>
<H2 CLASS="aa-sec3">
<A NAME="pgfId-439123"></A>Arguments</H2>
<P CLASS="nn-first">
<A NAME="pgfId-439124"></A>Our example system is very simple and has no need for execution arguments. In more advanced cases you may want to pass values to the execution, such as a numeric parameter or a file name, so that you can have different executions without changing and recompiling the software.
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-439125"></A>In the Eiffel text, you can access such run-time arguments through the Kernel Library class <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
ARGUMENTS</SPAN>
. There is another technique -- using the arguments to the root creation procedure -- but using <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
ARGUMENTS</SPAN>
 is the most general way. Any class of your system can inherit from <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
ARGUMENTS</SPAN>
 and use queries <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
argument_count</SPAN>
 to know the number of arguments passed to the execution, and <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
argument (</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
i</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
)</SPAN>
, for <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
i</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
 </SPAN>
between 1 and <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
argument_count</SPAN>
 to access the <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">
i</SPAN>
-th element. Class <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
ARGUMENTS</SPAN>
 has more features; since you have EiffelStudio up, you can check the details if you wish (use the short form).
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-439129"></A>To specify execution arguments from within EiffelStudio, <SPAN CLASS="ff-bold">
right-click</SPAN>
 the Run button (rather than left-click, which simply starts execution). The following panel comes up:
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-439137"></A>If this system required arguments, you would enter them here, separated by spaces. Clicking <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Run</SPAN>
 will start an execution with these arguments; clicking <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
OK </SPAN>
will simply record the arguments. Later executions will keep the same arguments even if the above panel is not up any more. To change them, right-click the Run button again to bring the panel back. (Using right-click on a command icon to set command parameters, where left-clicking on the icon simply executes the command, is a general convention also applied by EiffelStudio in several other contexts.)
<P CLASS="nn-normal">
<A NAME="pgfId-439144"></A>Here there would be no use for arguments, so you can just dismiss this panel by clicking <SPAN CLASS="ee-keyword">
Cancel</SPAN>
.
