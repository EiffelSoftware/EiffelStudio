<H1>The ISE Free Eiffel Library License (IFELL)</H1>
		(This license describes the terms applicable to the open-source EiffelBase libraries.
		For the EiffelStudio and other libraries license terms, please refer to the ISE end-user license.)

		On August 4, 1998 -- as part of the Eiffel Summit at TOOLS USA '98 -- Interactive
		Software Engineering (ISE)	officially made its flagship
		<A HREF="../../libraries/base/index.html">EiffelBase library</A>
		available for free to any organization that wants to use it, for either
		commercial or nonprofit purposes.

		<P>
		The terms of the new EiffelBase license are given below.
		Changes since the original version are recorded in the
		<A HREF="#changes">changes section</a>.

		<P>
		We hope that others will be inspired by this example to release their
		own reusable Eiffel components to the public.
		<H2>Preamble</H2>
		(This Preamble is not part of the license.)

		<P>
		EiffelBase is one of the principal contributions of Eiffel: a library of
		fundamental structures and algorithms covering the basics of computing,
		and resulting from a "Linnaean" effort at a general-purpose taxonomy of
		computing structures. We believe that EiffelBase is one of the most carefully
		designed and extensively used libraries in the object-oriented industry.
		The library and its design principles are described in detail in the
		book
		<A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/documentation.html#ru"><I>Reusable Software: The Base
		Object-Oriented Component Libraries</I></A>.


		<P>
		EiffelBase is at the center of ISE Eiffel and has been among the major
		factors attracting users to the technology. In spite of this competitive
		advantage, ISE officially announced in June of 1998 that it would
		release the library to the public in source form, under the terms
		of the license below. There are two main reasons for this initiative:

		<UL>
			<LI>As the software industry seems poised to adopt the idea of reusable
					components, we feel that EiffelBase provides an ideal basis and
					are happy to contribute it to the community.</LI>

			<LI>We are impressed by the quality of some  public-domain software
					and the effectiveness of the "open source" movement. We hope that
					the public availability of EiffelBase in source form will encourage
					many people to take a close look at the classes of EiffelBase,
					criticize its weaker points, provide improvements, and add their
					own high-quality contributions.</LI>
		</UL>


		<H3>About the license</H3>
		<P>
		After considering existing license contracts for publicly available
		software, we felt that the GPL (Gnu Public License) as well
		as LGPL, its variant for libraries, while useful and interesting,
		were not adequate since they are too restrictive.


		<a name="contamination"></a>
		<P>
		In particular a crucial requirement was that the license should allow
		commercial companies to use EiffelBase (and other libraries that
		may use this license in the future) in for-profit developments
		without any fear (justified or not) that GPL-like
		requirements could cause proprietary elements of
		their products to come under the open source umbrella themselves.


		<P>
		The closest model was that of the Perl Artistic License, which
		significantly influenced the terms of the agreement as shown below.
		It too, however, was not applicable verbatim. EiffelBase was initially
		designed as a commercial product and then released as free software,
		a different situation from that of software that was never commercial.


		<P>
		You will note that there are few restrictions on the use
		of EiffelBase in the license given below. You can use EiffelBase
		in your academic work and re-publish the source; you can produce
		a commercial software product using EiffelBase and not owe a
		cent to ISE.


		<H3>Ownership</H3>
		<P>
		EiffelBase remains an ISE product and will continue to be distributed
		as such to ISE customers. This means in particular that there is
		no lessening of our maintenance and support responsibility
		to our customers under maintenance. In fact, the increased scrutiny
		and outside contributions will mean an increase of our commitment
		to develop EiffelBase and of the quality of the product.


		<H2>The License Text</H2>
		<P>
		This is the official license text.


		<H3>Definitions</H3>

		"ISE" refers to Interactive Software Engineering Inc.

		<P>
		"The Library" refers to the collection of software texts in the Eiffel
		language, originally written by ISE, and constituting the EiffelBase library
		of fundamental computing science structures, as well as any derivatives of
		these texts as may be created through textual modification (by people) or
		through translation to lower-level languages (by programs such as compilers).


		<P>
		"Standard Version" refers to the version of the Library maintained by ISE
		and distributed by ISE to its customers under maintenance.


		<P>
		"You" means any person interested in using, modifying or distributing the Library.


		<P>
		"Source form" means the text of the the Library's classes, in
		the Eiffel language.


		<P>
		"Object form" means the translation, as performed by a
		compiler or other program, of the Library or part of the Library
		into another, usually lower-level code (such as C, assembly language
		or machine language) intended for execution by a machine.


		<a name="reference_implementation"></a>
		<P>
		"Reference implementation" means the latest officially released
		version of ISE's implementation of the Eiffel language.


		<H3>Statement of copyright and ownership</H3>

		<P>
		<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">1.</FONT></B> The Library is the property of ISE and bears ISE's copyright.
		Any use you make of the Library must respect ISE's proprietary rights.

		<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">2.</FONT></B> ISE hereby grants you permission to do any of the following
		without payment to ISE, under the conditions of sections 3 to 7
		of this Agreement:
		<UL>
			<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">2.1.</FONT></B> Use the Library, in source form or object form, as part of any software

		<H3>Conditions</H3>
		<P>

		<a name="encourage_bug_reports"></a>
		<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">3.</FONT></B> If you use (2.1) or distribute (2.2) the Library, you are <FONT COLOR="#A00000">encouraged</FONT>, but not required,
		to provide to
		ISE and the rest of the Library's user community any bug fixes
		or other improvements
		that you make to the existing classes of the Library.
		Such changes may be communicated through any appropriate means; it is
		recommended that you deposit new classes in the FTP directory for
		contributions, currently
		<UL>
		<A HREF ftp://ftp.eiffel.com/pub/incoming>ftp://ftp.eiffel.com/pub/incoming</A>
		</UL>

		If you produce new classes based on the Library or extending
		the Library,
		you are <FONT COLOR="#A00000">encouraged</FONT>, but not required,
		to make them available in the same way.

		<P>
		<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">5.</FONT></B> If you use the Library (2.1) in source or object form for
		producing software that you distribute, you are <FONT COLOR="#A00000">encouraged</FONT>,

		<UL>
				<I>This product includes EiffelBase software from Interactive Software
						Engineering, used according to the terms of the ISE Free Eiffel Library
						License (IFELL). See <A HREF="http://eiffel.com/page.html">http://eiffel.com</A>
						and, for the license terms,
						<A HREF="http://eiffel.com/products/base/license.html">http://eiffel.com/products/base/license.html</A>.
				</I>
		</UL>
		<P>
		<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">6.</FONT></B> If you distribute the source code of part or all of the Library (2.2)
		you must:
		<UL>
			<LI>Distribute entire classes, not just extracts.</LI>
			<LI>Retain, in the distributed version, the entire copyright notice of these
				classes.</LI>
			<LI>If you need to make any modification to the classes, mark those modifications
				clearly in the class texts.</LI>
			<LI>	<a name="valid_eiffel"></a>
					Ensure that the text remains valid Eiffel.
					Note that this license does not authorize you to
					distribute versions of the Library restated in other programming,
					analysis or design languages, except if
					mechanically translated from the source form by an Eiffel compiler,
					in which case they fall under "object form". For any non-mechanical
					adaptation to other languages you must obtain authorization from ISE.
					"Valid Eiffel" includes the language described in the latest
					edition or printing of the book
					<A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/page.html#etl"><i>Eiffel: The Language</i></a>
					(Prentice Hall), plus any changes or extensions that have been
					approved by the Nonprofit International Consortium for Eiffel (NICE)
					or have been accepted for discussion by the Language Committee
					of NICE, provided they are accepted by the reference implementation.</LI>
			<LI><a name="obsolete_version"></a>
					If ISE releases a new version of the Library, you must, no
					later than six months after the release of that version,
					either: (A) update your distribution to the
					new version; (B) add the following notice to all files in your distribution:
					"<i>This is an obsolete version of EiffelBase.  The latest version
					is available from http://eiffel.com</i>"; or (C) cease distributing your version.</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>
		You may not charge any fee for the distribution
		of the Library (source or binary),
		although you may charge for software that
		includes the Library in whole or in part as per the other provisions
		of this Agreement.

		<P>
		<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">7.</FONT></B> You may not use the name of ISE to endorse or promote products derived from
		the Library without specific prior written permission.

		<P>
		<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">8.</FONT></B> THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
		AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
		LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF	MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR
		A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
		<a name="changes"></a>
		<H2>Changes</H2>
		(This list of changes is not part of the license.)
		<P>
		<b><font color="#0000a0">General note on changes</font></b>:
		as usage of free EiffelBase grows and more people contribute to it,
		some terms of the license text may occasionally have to be changed
		in light of this accumulated experience and of comments
		received from users and contributors. It is our intention to ensure that
		<UL>
			<LI>	(1) Any such changes will be minor, affecting the details of the
					licensing rather than the spirit of IFELL.</LI>
			<LI>	(2) If they affect the substance of the license in any way, they go in
					the general direction of extending, not restricting, the rights of users
					of EiffelBase.</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>
		Should a question arise regarding use of EiffelBase, the terms
		to be applied are those in effect at the time of use, disregarding
		any later change.

		<P>
		<b>28 June 2000</b>: in response to comments by
		Joachim Durchholz through Patrick Schoenbach,
		replacement of most occurrences of the word "EiffelBase" by
		"the Library" to facilitate application to other libraries.

		<P>
		<b>7 May 1999</b>: in response to comments by David Broadfoot on
		the ISE Eiffel user list, rewording of the
		<A HREF="#contamination">explanation</a>
		of why we are applying more liberal terms than GPL-style licenses.
		regarding fears of <A HREF="#contamination">contamination</a>
		with the Gnu Public License.

		<P>
		<b>6 May 1999</b>: following comments by Ed Avis and Alexander Kjeldaas,
		we now permit distribution maintainers to
		continue distributing an old version as long as they
		<A HREF="#obsolete_version">mention clearly that it's obsolete</A>.

		<P>
		<b>7 April 1999</b>: following comments by Loryn Jenkins and Ed Avis,
		removal of the requirement that bug fixes
		and improvements be provided back to the maintainers of the library.
		This requirement has been changed to a mere
		<A HREF="#encourage_bug_reports">encouragement</a>, facilitating
		use of the library. Of course it is in everyone's interest to
		report bugs and improvements.

		<P>
		<b>7 April 1999</b>: following comments by Loryn Jenkins,
		loosening of the
		<A HREF="#valid_eiffel">definition of "valid Eiffel"</a>.
		This change also caused addition of the notion
		of <A HREF="#reference_implementation">reference implementation</a>.
		The purpose is to avoid crippling EiffelBase by preventing it from
		utilizing innovative language constructs and corrections in the
		language contributions. Such language extensions are OK as long
		as they have been accepted for discussion by NICE and are supported
		by the reference implementation.

		<P>
		<b>1 April 1999</b>: following some comments by Richard Stallman,
		addition of a qualification ("<i>justified or not</i>") to the notes
		regarding fears of <A HREF="#contamination">contamination</a>
		with the Gnu Public License.
		Our intention is not to criticize the GPL but simply to note that the
		GPL does cause some fears, "justified or not", among commercial developers.
