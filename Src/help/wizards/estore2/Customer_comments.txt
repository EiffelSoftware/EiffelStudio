Extract from PG Crismer feedback from the Wizard (version from June 01)

"
Here is my first experience report :
0- * looks pretty good *
1- Step4 does not create a new directory if directory name does not exist
(failure) : it is annoying.
2- DLL 'minilzo.dll' not found : the wizard crashes.
3- ODBC : retrieving all tables can be time-consuming (our database has
*thousands* of tables).  Suggestion : ask for a specific
    catalog or user space
4- Oracle : while connecting, only username and password are required.  Host
name is also required.  I could get around this problem
    by providing 'user@hostname';  The oracle version only retrieves tables
from 'user' name space, which is better than for ODBC.
5- "table width" problem : it is common to find tables that have *hundreds*
of columns (I know one here with more than 200 columns).
    Generating a class for this table would be completely crazy.  How can I
select the columns I want ?
