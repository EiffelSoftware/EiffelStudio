A generic class `TEST1 [G, ARRAY_TYPE -> ARRAY[G] create make end]'
has a function of type ARRAY_TYPE that creates an object of type
ARRAY_TYPE.  A second class TEST2 generic inherits `TEST1 [G, ARRAY
[G]]'.  Another class creates an instance of TEST2, calls the function
and prints `area.generating_type' on the result.  It prints SPECIAL
[INTEGER_8] instead of SPECIAL [STRING].
