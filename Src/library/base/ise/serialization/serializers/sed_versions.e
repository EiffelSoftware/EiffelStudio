feature -- Access

	version_5_6: NATURAL_32 = 0
			-- Original introducting of Eiffel serialization.

	version_6_6: NATURAL_32 = 3
			-- Added support for recoverable serialization (aka correct mismatch)
			--| It starts at 3 because in version 7.2, values one and two were
			--| used to version session/basic serialization but really there was no
			--| need to version them since it can only work inside the same application.

	version_7_3: NATURAL_32 = 4
			-- Added support for expanded and reference with copy semantics.
