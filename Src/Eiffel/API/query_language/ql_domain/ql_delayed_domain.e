					Object that represents a delayed domain used in Eiffel query language
		
					 A delayed domain means that `content' of the domain is not defined until a certain time.
					 For example, in query:
					     from "base" select class as c where (count feature from c > 10)
					 in this query, c is a delayed domain. Content of this delayed domain
					 is only meaningful when this query is executed. To be more detailed, when this query
					 executes, it will iterate all classes in group "base", and for every class, c
					 defines a domain which has one item which is the current iterated class in it.
