test_name 	 expanded-generic-like-current
test_description A class inherits a feature `weasel: TEST3 [like Current]' where TEST3 is an expanded class.  In an instance of the parent class `weasel' is non-Void (it better be since it is of an expanded type).  But in the inheriting class `weasel' is Void, which should be impossible.
