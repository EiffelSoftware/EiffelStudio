feature -- Access

	short_cache_name: STRING is "md"
			-- Short cache name.
			-- Note: this should be as short as possible given file name
			-- length restriction on Windows. This is name used when
			-- running in `conservative_mode'

			-- Cache name.

	conservative_mode: BOOLEAN is True
			-- State to indicate if cache should be conservative when creating paths
			-- to cached contents

	cache_lock_id: SYSTEM_STRING is
			-- id used to lock cache.
			-- Note: This has to be unique per user since accessing a Mutex created by
			-- a different user causes a security exception. This means that concurrent
			-- cache access by different users is not supported.
