<h2>General description</h2>
<p>Basically, we will promote classes that are multiply-inherited into .NET
interfaces. To give an example if in Eiffel you have:</p>
<pre>class
	C
inherit
	A
	B
end</pre>
<p>then in .NET you might have the following set of classes and interfaces:</p>
<pre>class A implements IA
class B implements IB
class C implements IA and IB

interface IA
interface IB</pre>
<p>This is one way of seeing it, but we could generate it in many different
ways. It is important that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Eiffel for .NET compiler through the Assembly
Manager can re-read the metadata
to go back to the original form</li>
  <li>other languages can understand the
metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the last point, we decided that we would indeed generate the
following set of classes and interfaces:</p>
<pre>class A_IMP implements A
class B_IMP implements B
class C_IMP implements A and B

interface B
interface C</pre>

<p>So if in Eiffel you have the following piece of code:</p>

<pre>b: B
c: C

create c
b := c</pre>

<p>It will translate in C# as:</p>

<pre>B b;
C c;

/* Method 1 */
c = new C_IMP();
b = c;

/* Method 2 */
c = EiffelFactory.new_C();
b = c;</pre>

<p class="note"><b>Note:<br>
</b>Creation is performed in two different ways. One through the use of a .NET
constructor, and the second one through a factory call. Both will be implemented
in case there is no way to use the .NET constructor mechanism, but we will try
to stick as much as possible on the use of .NET constructor.</p>

<h2>
<a name="Real example"></a>
A real example</h2>

<p>
Let's suppose we have the following example. In which we do most of what can be
seen in an Eiffel library that uses multiple inheritance.
<pre>class
	A
feature
	f is do ... end
	g (x: X) is do ... end
end</pre>
<pre>class B
inherit
	A
		rename f as h
		redefine g
		end
feature
	g (y: Y) is do ... end
end</pre>
<pre>class C
inherit
	A
end</pre>
<pre>class
	D
inherit
	B
		select
			g
		end
	C
		rename
			g as C_g
		select
			f
		end
end</pre>
<pre>deferred class F
feature
	f is do ... end
end</pre>
<pre>class E
inherit
	C
		undefine f end
	F
end</pre>
<pre>class X
end</pre>
<pre>class Y
inherit X
end</pre>
<p>This is better described by the following BON diagram:<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../diamond_inheritance.png" width="484" height="216"><p>Let's
have a look at what we should generate as an inheritance hierarchy:<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="diamond_inheritance_on_dotnet-method2.png" width="661" height="476">
<p>The hierarchy is much simpler than the first method.</p>
<pre>.interface A {
	f ();
	g (X x);
}

.class A_IMP: A {
	f () { call s_f (Current); };
	g (X x) { call s_g (Current, x); };

	static s_f (A a) { ... };
	static s_g (A a, X x) { ... };
}</pre>

<pre>.interface B: A {
	h ();
	g (Y y);
}

.class B_IMP: B {
	h {} {
		.override A::f
		call A_IMP::s_f (Current);
	};

	g (Y y) { call s_g (Current, y); };

	private __g (X x) {
		.override A::g
		call s_g ((Y) x))
	}

	static s_g (B b, Y y) { ... }
}</pre>

<pre>.interface C: A

.class C_IMP: C {
	f () { call A_IMP::s_f (Current); };
	g (X x) { call A_IMP::s_g (Current, x); };
}</pre>

<pre>.interface D: B, C {
	C_g (X x);
}

.class D_IMP: D {
	f() { call A_IMP::s_f (Current); };
	h () { call A_IMP::s_f (Current); };
	g (Y y) { call B_IMP::s_g (Current, y); };		
	C_g (X x) { call A_IMP::s_g (Current, x); };
}</pre>

<pre>.interface F {
	f();
}

.class F_IMP: F {
	f() { call s_f (Current); };

	static s_f (F f) { ... };
}</pre>

<pre>.interface E: C, F

.class E_IMP: E {
	f() {
		.override C::f
		call F_IMP::s_f (Current);
	};
	g(X x) { call A_IMP::s_g (Current, x); };
}</pre>

<h2>An explanation</h2>
<p>Let's explain the previous example and let's determine what gets generated in 
the interfaces and what gets implemented in the implementation classes.</p>
<h3>Interface</h3>
<p>In the interface, will be generated the signature of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>renamed features of the origin class</li>
  <li>explicitly redefined features where covariance is done</li>
  <li>implicitly redefined features where parameter, return type or one of the 
  local variables is an anchored type whose type has been changed in Current 
  (typically a like Current or a like something, where something has been 
  redefined in a covariant manner).</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><b>Note</b>:<br>
We do not yet take into account local variables for inserting a feature in the 
interface.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>In the implementation class, we will generate all inherited features (defined 
in the parent interfaces) as stub to a call to their static definition. The 
static definition of a feature is generated in the implementation class 
corresponding to the origin class where the feature is actually written. This 
avoids to have too many static definitions everywhere that almost look a like.</p>
