		<H1>EiffelStudio window overview</H1>
        <H2>Window layout</H2>

        <P>Unlike its predecessor EiffelBench, in EiffelStudio all windows have
        the same components. However, components to be displayed are chosen by
        the user. Moreover, windows have two modes: the edition mode and the
        debug mode. Basically, a standard window looks like this:</P>

		<P align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/general_edition_mode.png"></P>

		<P>As you can see, it is divided in several parts: a top section, a left
        panel, a right panel and a status bar.</P>

        <P>The top part is rather not surprising. It first contains a menu bar,
        which adapts itself to the context of the current project. It also
        contains two toolbars (the main toolbar and the project toolbar).
        Between the toolbars is located the main address bar.</P>

        <P>The left panel contains various <i> tools</i> that help the navigation in the
        system.</P>

		<P>The right panel contains two major tools: the editor and the context
        tool.</P>

        <p>The status bar supplies various information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Its first field gives punctual information concerning a recent
            operation (such as loading a project, syntax errors in a class text,
            etc.).</li>
          <li>The second field contains the name of the current project, which
            can come quite handy if you work on several projects simultaneously.</li>
          <li>The next field contains the current line and column in the main
            editor of the window (lines and columns start at position 1).</li>
          <li>The last three fields contain icons representing the state of the
            project, according to several points of view.
            <ul>
              <li>The first icon indicates whether some class files have been
                edited since the last compilation. This makes it easy to know
                whether you have changes to take into account
                ( <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_editing.gif"></img> or 
                <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_exe_up_to_date.gif"></img> ) 
                and whether you should recompile.</li>
              <li>The second icon gives the compilation state of the project. It
                may indicate either that the last compilation was successful
                <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_compiled.gif"></img>, or
                that it failed <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_compilation_error.gif"></img>
                or that the project is being compiled <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_compiling_2.gif"></img>.</li>
              <li>The last icon gives the state of the debugger. It may indicate
                that the application is running <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_running_2.gif"></img>,
                paused <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_stopped.gif"></img>
                or dead (no icon).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <P>In debug mode, a window looks like this:</P>

        <P align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/general_debug_mode.png"></P>

        <P>In debug mode, the same tools are present, but there are three extra
        tools. Two are located in the left panel, which display respectively the
        call stack and the dynamic value of expressions. The other is in the
        right panel and can be use to view the state of objects while debugging.</P>

        <h2>Layout configuration</h2>

        <h3>Tool configuration</h3>

        <P>All tools have similar controls to give their display options. It is
        possible to minimize, restore and maximize all tools by using the proper
        button in their top right-hand corner. Most tools can also be closed. These tools have a close button in the
        corner.</P>

		<UL>
            <li>The minimize button <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_minimize_color.gif" width="8" height="8"></li>
            <li>The maximize button <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_maximize_color.gif" width="8" height="8"></li>
            <li>The restore button <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_restore_color.gif" width="8" height="8"></li>
            <li>The close button <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_close_color.gif" width="8" height="8"></li>
		</UL>

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: No more than three tools can be displayed at the
same time in the left panel. Trying to add more will automatically minimize one
of the displayed tools, in order to make room for the new tool.</p>

        <P>Tools that can be closed have a corresponding entry in the <b>View/Explorer
        Bar</b> menu. They also have a corresponding button in the main toolbar.</P>

        <P>The only tools that cannot be closed are the editor, and when in
        debug mode the debug tools.</P>

        <h3>Toolbar configuration</h3>

        <P>Both main toolbars can be customized. This allows to select buttons that
        should be displayed in the toolbars, as well as whether an explanatory
        text should be displayed next to icons.</P>

        <h2>Context tool</h2>

        <P>The context tool, located in the right panel, is a major part of
        EiffelStudio. It itself contains several tabs that each correspond to
        some powerful functionality.</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>The <b>Output</b> tab is where general information and error
              messages are displayed
            <li>The <b>Diagram</b> tab uses the BON notation to analyze and
              design a project</li>
            <li>The <b>Class</b> tab gives advanced information concerning a
              class</li>
            <li>The <b>Feature</b> tab gives advanced information concerning a
              feature</li>
			<LI>The <b>Metrics</b> tab provides quantitative information
              concerning a system or some of its components
		</UL>

        <P>By default, the context tool is unlinked from the rest of the window,
        which means all
        left tools refer to the object that is in the editor and the main
        toolbar, while the context tool (and the debug tools if they are
        present) displays information concerning a
        different object. It is possible to link the context tool, so that the
        whole development window displays information relative to the same
        development object.</P>
