A class creates an object of type `ARRAY [BIT 70000]' and prints its
generating type.  The generating type prints as "ARRAY [BIT 4464]"
instead of "ARRAY [BIT 70000]" or "ARRAY [BIT_REF]".  C compiler
issues warnings about "overflow in implicit constant conversion".

Discovered in Release 5.4.0403.
