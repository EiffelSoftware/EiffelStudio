				Object that reprent a status
				The status of a problem can be one of the following:

			Open The initial state of a Problem Report. This means the PR has been filed and the responsible person(s) notified.
			Analyzed The responsible person has analyzed the problem. The analysis should contain a preliminary evaluation of the problem and an estimate of the amount of time and resources necessary to solve the problem. It should also suggest possible workarounds.
			Closed A Problem Report is closed only when any changes have been integrated, documented, and tested, and the submitter has confirmed the solution
			Suspended Work on the problem has been postponed. This happens if a timely solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time. The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being actively sought. If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed rather than suspended.
			Won't fix Won't fix problem report.
