test_name 	bit-n-out-of-memory
test_description A class tries to print the generating type of the expression `create {TEST1 [BIT n]' where `n: INTEGER is 8'.  When the system is melted, system execution ends with an "out of memory" error.  Frozen code works correctly, except that it prints "TEST1 [BIT_REF]" instead of the expected "TEST1 [BIT 8]".
