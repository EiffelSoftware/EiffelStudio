A system with a generic class with formal parameter G compiles fine.
When a new class G is added to the universe, the (numerous) VCFG
violations introduced are detected.  But when return is pressed, the
compiler proceeds merrily with the compilation, ignoring the
still-present VCFG violations.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
