To keep in mind at all time:
- Make a ELKS compliant library
- Adopt consistence style / naming convention (TBD)
- Not compiler specific except through use of `builtin' for
  which consensus among developers is required.

To achieve:
- Implement ELKS specified classes
- Unicode string and character
- Descent I/O classes
