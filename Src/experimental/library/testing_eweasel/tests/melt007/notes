A routine with precondition `false' is redefined with alternative
precondition `true' in a descendant.  When the system is compiled via
melting both classes, system execution results in a precondition
violation (which is wrong).  When the same system is frozen and
executed, there are no precondition violations.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
