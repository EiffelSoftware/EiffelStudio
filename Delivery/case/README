EiffelCase 4.2B advice and warnings:

0) Installation

You need to set $EIFFEL4 to the installation directory of ISE Eiffel 4.
You need to also set $PLATFORM.

To install EiffelCase
	Untar the package into $EIFFEL4 directory 
	(cd $EIFFEL4 && tar xvfz case_4_2.tar.gz) 

Include into your path:
        $EIFFEL4/case/spec/$PLATFORM/bin

To run eiffelcase type:
        ecase
	

1) Printing

On Windows, make sure to set up the printer as GREY SCALE
and to use the LPT1 port.

On Unix, select color printer only if the printer is a
color printer.

2) Resizing the work area

For better results,avoid resizing the work area by
adding clusters and classes close to the border. Instead,
resize explicitly by dragging the bottom-right corner.

3)  Before generating code, make sure that:

		* One class has been designated as "Root Class".
		  (You must manually add a creation clause in the
		  Eiffel class text.)

		* Any class that has deferred features is marked as deferred.
		  EiffelCase should enforce this but does not; Eiffel compilation
		  messages may result.

	 	* If a class is declared as deferred, at least one feature
		  is deferred.

		* The postconditions, preconditions and invariants are valid
		  Eiffel (EiffelCase does not fully check this.

4) Reverse engineering

If you perform a reverse engineering and wish to see all the classes 
and clusters that you coded, make sure that they are all in the system
generated by es4.

5) Merging Tool

It may appear that the last difference between the Eiffel and Case versions
is not a real difference. If so just click Exit.
This has no adverse effect on behavior and performance.

Please refer to the manual for further information.
