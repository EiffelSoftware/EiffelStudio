        <H2>What is a Widget?</H2>
        <P>
			A Widget is the fundamental building block of your applications GUI,
        components such as Windows, Buttons and Labels are examples of such.&nbsp;
        The widget set of Vision2 provide you with the flexibility to easily create powerful
        graphical applications.&nbsp; All widgets in
        Vision2 inherit from <a href="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chart.html"> EV_WIDGET</a> and the features provided in
        <a CLASS="eclass" href="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chart.html"><SPAN Class="eclass"> EV_WIDGET</SPAN></a>
        may be called on any widget.

        <P>&nbsp;

        <H2>Variations of Widget
			</H2>
			<P>
			Within Vision2, widgets have been classified into three different groups:
			<UL>
				<LI><A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/10_widgets/00_primitives/index.html">Primitives</A>
                  -- These are elements of the user interface that are mainly
                  responsible for interaction with the user, such as an <a href="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_button_chart.html">EV_BUTTON</a>.
				<LI><A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/10_widgets/10_containers/index.html">Containers</A>
                  -- These are used to contain other widgets and position them
                  in a certain way, such as an <a href="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_vertical_box_chart.html"> EV_VERTICAL_BOX
                  </a> that stacks its
                  children one by one vertically.
				<LI><A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/10_widgets/20_common_dialogs/index.html">Dialogs</A>
                  -- These are popup dialog windows used for interacting with the user for tasks such as opening a
                  file (<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/dialogs/ev_file_open_dialog_chart.html">EV_FILE_OPEN_DIALOG</A>) or displaying a message (<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/dialogs/ev_message_dialog_chart.html">EV_MESSAGE_DIALOG</A>).
		  You may construct your own dialogs by inheriting <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/dialogs/ev_dialog_chart.html">EV_DIALOG</A>.
			</UL>
        <h2>How do I create a widget?</h2>
        <p>All widgets in Vision2 are based around the default_create mechanism
        in Eiffel, this means that all that needs to be done to create a widget
        is to declare a reference to a type (such as <a href="../../reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_button_chart.html">EV_BUTTON</a>) and then call
        create on that reference.&nbsp; An example of this is as follows.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <SPAN Class ="code"><SPAN Class="efeature">a_button:</SPAN> <SPAN Class="eclass">EV_BUTTON</SPAN><BR>
        <SPAN Class="ekeyword">create</SPAN> <SPAN Class="efeature">a_button</SPAN>
        </SPAN>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Along with the default creation, Vision2 also includes a few
        convenience creation functions.&nbsp; Examples of this are
        make_with_text for all widgets that may have text associated with them
        (those that inherit from <a href="../../reference/interface/properties/ev_textable_chart.html"> EV_TEXTABLE</a>), this saves a call to set_text
        upon default creation of the textable widget.</p>
  
        <p><SPAN Class="ekeyword"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <SPAN Class="code">create <SPAN Class="efeature">a_button.make_with_text
        (<SPAN Class="estring">&quot;Click Me&quot;</SPAN>)</SPAN></SPAN></p>
    
        <p>This would be in place of</p>
        <blockquote>
        <SPAN Class ="code"><SPAN Class="ekeyword">create</SPAN> <SPAN Class="efeature">a_button</SPAN><BR>
        <SPAN Class="efeature">a_button.set_text (<SPAN Class="estring">&quot;Click Me&quot;</SPAN>)</SPAN></SPAN>
       
       
          </blockquote>
          
        <p Class="note">Note: When a widget is created no extra initialization has to be
        performed, <b>the only exception is for a window where you have to call
        show in order for it to be displayed on screen</b>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
<H2>Sizing</H2>
        <P>
		As <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_primitive_chart.html">EV_PRIMITIVE</A> is of type <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chart.html">EV_WIDGET</A>, the following
        facilities are provided for setting the minimum size : <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_set_minimum_width">set_minimum_width</A>, 
		<A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_set_minimum_height">set_minimum_height</A> and <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_set_minimum_size">set_minimum_size</A>.
		</P>
        <P>&nbsp;
		</P>
        <P>The minimum size of a widget is the smallest possible size that it
        can possibly be inside its parent container.&nbsp; If an <a href="../../reference/interface/widgets/primitives/ev_button_chart.html">EV_BUTTON</a>
        was
        created and set with a minimum_size of width/height (100, 100), if this
        button was inserted in to an <a href="../../reference/interface/widgets/containers/ev_horizontal_box_chart.html"> EV_HORIZONTAL_BOX</a>, then the box's size
        could never be below (100, 100) or it would break the minimum size of
        the button.&nbsp; <b>The size of a container must always be greater or
        equal to the minimum sizes of its children.</b>
		</P>
		<P CLASS="note"><B>Note: </B>In Vision2, there is no way to set the current size of the primitive. The current size is dependent on the size of the <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_parent">parent</A> or the minimum_size.</P>
		
        <h2>Now what do I do?</h2>
    	&nbsp; Now that you can create a widget, you will need to actually make it
        usable to your intended user, this will usually involve these three
        steps.<BR>
        <ul>
        <LI>Setting <a href="/libraries/vision2/content/40_properties/index.html"> properties</a> for the widget
          such as color and the minimum size that a widget can possibly be in
          its parent container.</LI>
        <LI>Making the widget respond to user <a href="/libraries/vision2/content/30_events/index.html"> events</a> via the use of agents and
        action sequences.</LI>
        <LI>Placing the widget inside a <a href="/libraries/vision2/content/10_widgets/10_containers/index.html"> container</a>
          widget (either a window or a child of a window) so it can be shown on
          screen.</LI>
