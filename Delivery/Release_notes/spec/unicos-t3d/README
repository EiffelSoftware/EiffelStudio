RELEASE NOTE FOR CRAY unicos-t3d VERSION.

Please your PLATFORM environment variable to unicos-t3d if you
are running on CRAY unicos-t3d. 

This version of ISE Eiffel provides only the run-times located
$EIFFEL5/bench/spec/unicos-t3d/lib/. . You will also found
the binary `finish_freezing' to compile the generated C-code in
	$EIFFEL5/bench/spec/unicos-t3d/bin/.

To run an Eiffel program on CRAY you need to compile the
Eiffel code on another platform. Then, you will be able to compile
the generated C-code by launching `finish_freezing' on CRAY in
the <your_system_path>/EIFGEN/F_code .

PORTABILITY OF GENERATED C CODE
-------------------------------
Only the Finalized run-time in non MT-mode is porovided.
The Finalized C code (in EIFGEN/F_code) is fully portable between all the 
supported platforms.

SETTINGS BEFORE LAUNCHING C COMPILATION
---------------------------------------

You may have to unset TARGET and use the production compiler before any  
compilation:

setting the production compiler:
% eval `setpe prod`

unsetting TARGET:
% unsetenv TARGET

Updating PLATFORM:
% setenv PLATFORM unicos-t3d

The tests on CRAY have been performed with this settings.

BUGS ON CRAYs
-------------

the loader `ld' does not work properly, we use the archiver `ar' instead. Because of that, you cannot generate automatically the CECIL library.

MULTITHREADED MODE
-----------------

The pthread library is not provided on Unicos-t3d, then there is no multithreaded run-time.

SHARED LIBRARY
--------------

There is no shared Eiffel run-time library available.
