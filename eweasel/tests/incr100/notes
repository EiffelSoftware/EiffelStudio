A system with a root class which has an external routine with an alias
compiles fine and is correctly frozen even if only melting is
requested.  Then the Ace is changed to indicate a new root class,
which does not have any external routines.  When the system is
recompiled, the compiler terminates silently after pass 5 on the new
root class.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
