1.0 ADMIN/NON INTERACTIVE INSTALLATIONS:
----------------------------------------

If you want to install EiffelStudio/EiffelEnvision in admin mode without any interactions, such
the case of multiple installations please read the following:

1.1 Installer Properties
------------------------

1.1.1 Require Properties

There are a number of variables that *have* to be set to install successfully. These are detailed below:

    - C_CONFIG_NAME       : Either "msc", for using a preinstalled Microsoft C/C++ compiler or "mingw" to install and use GCC.
                            NOTE: GCC can only be used for the x86 version of EiffelStudio.

    - PID                 : For Enterprise editions of any installer a personal identifier is require, which is in the form of a CD-KEY for the
                            installing application. For GPL/Free Trial installations this information is not required.

1.1.2 Optional Properties
                           
There are also a number of properties that can be optionally defined, but should be defined for they sake of sanity:
    
    - INSTALLDIR          : This is the installed location of the application being installed by the installer and should end in a directory
                            separator character '\'
            
    - * PRECOMPILE        : Use to specify the level of precompilation. Either "none", for no precompilation. "base", for precompiling EiffelBase
                            only. "wel", for precompiling EiffelBase and the Windows Eiffel Library. "vision2", for compiling EiffelBase, WEL and
                            EiffelVision2. The default is "vision2"
