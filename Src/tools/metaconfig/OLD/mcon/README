This is the root directory for metaconfig.

If you are new to metaconfig, you may wish to have a look at the INTRO
file, which gives a quick introduction.

The metaconfig you have here is a modified version of Larry Wall's 2.0
release.  The units themselves have been ripped off from some Configure
scripts (perl 4.0, elm 2.3).  They all carry a copyright from me, which
is not true, but it was automatically produced and I had no time yet to
set the proper copyrights for each unit.

Although metaconfig, as being part of dist, is covered by the Artistic
License, a Configure script is not copyrighted and belongs to the
public domain. Units can be copyrighted, and credits for each unit may
appear in the generated Configure script, at the author's request.

The manual page for metaconfig is not up-to-date.  The built-in
interpreter and the changes are documented in NOTES.

The units that come from dist 2.0 need to be changed. A script should be
provided in the final release to do an automatic conversion, which will
be fine 90% of the time. If you want to see how new features can be used,
I would recommend you to have a look at Oldconfig.U, d_gethname.U and
voidflags.U.
