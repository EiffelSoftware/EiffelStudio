A function that returns an expanded type has a postcondition that
states that `old Result' is not equal to the value of the function,
where the body of the function sets an attribute of Result to a
non-default value.  Melted code incorrectly violates the
postcondition, while frozen code does not.

Discovered in release 5.4.0515.
