test_name 	 vtat1-called-vtcg

test_description After initial compilation, an attribute used as an anchor in a type serving as actual generic parameter is changed to a procedure.  When the system is recompiled, the compiler incorrectly reports a VTCG error (which is impossible since the involved generic class has no generic constraints) instead of a VTAT(1) error.
