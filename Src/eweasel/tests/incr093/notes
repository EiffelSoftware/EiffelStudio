A class with a once function whose return type is a formal generic
parameter is correctly reported to violate VFFD(7).  Then a class with
the same name as the formal parameter is added to one of the clusters.
When compilation is resumed, the compiler still reports VFFD(7)
instead of VCFG(1).

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
