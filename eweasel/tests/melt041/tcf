test_name 	bit-two-to-the-fifteen
test_description A class has a call to a function which takes an argument of type BIT N and just returns its argument.  The system compiles fine, but when executed it dies with the exception "object allocation: No more memory" if it was melted and if N >= 32768 (2 ^ 15).  Frozen code works fine for BIT sizes up to at least 1_000_000.
