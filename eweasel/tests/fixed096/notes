Removing one of the formal generic parameters from a generic class
causes the compiler to accept it as valid, even though another class
now has an entity with the wrong number of actual generic parameters.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.  However, the compiler does not
die with an exception trace once it discovers the VTUG violation and
the violation is corrected.

Fixed in Prerelease 93.07.15.
