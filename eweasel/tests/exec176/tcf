test_name 	 assign-attempt-anchored-tuple
test_description A routine which does an assignment attempt of a TUPLE to a local that is a TUPLE type with an anchored type (e.g., `TUPLE [like i, INTEGER, INTEGER]') works correctly if the anchored type is `like Current'.  It does not work correctly if anchored to a routine argument.  In finalized mode, it also does not work correctly if anchored to an attribute.
