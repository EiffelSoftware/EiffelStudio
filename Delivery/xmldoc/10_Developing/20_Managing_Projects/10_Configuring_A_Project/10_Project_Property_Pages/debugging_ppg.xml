		<paragraph>The action properties are user-specific properties and will not be  applied to the project as a whole, but saved in a separate user configuration  file. Theses user specific settings do not require a project recompilation to  reflect their changes.</paragraph>

		<paragraph>  If your project is requires a client application to function  correctly, such in the case of a Class Library project,then you will need  to specify a client application to use when debugging.</paragraph>
		<note>

		<paragraph>This property tells the compiler whether or not to generate the debugging  information needed by the debugger to debug your project. It is recommended  that this option is set to true for all debugging related configurations, and  set to false for any release related configurations. If this property is set to  false you will be unable to debug the code for the selected project.</paragraph>
		<note>
			<bold>Note</bold>: For precompile library project the debugging information is always generated.
