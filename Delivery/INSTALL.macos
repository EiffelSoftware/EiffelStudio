Installing EiffelStudio 5.3 on Mac OS X

Before installing the Eiffel53.tgz package you need to install the following components:

1 - Install Mac OS X X11 server:

	Available from Apple web site at:
	http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/ 
	http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/

	You also need the X11 SDK in order to develop graphical application
	with EiffelVision2 at:
	http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/download/
	

2 - Install GTK 1.2.10:

	You need to download GTK 1.2.10 by following the instructions located at:
	http://packages.opendarwin.org

	The package is located under:
	http://packages.opendarwin.org/mpkgs/x11/gtk-1.2.10.mpkg


3 - Install `libcompat':

	Follow the same instructions as for downloading GTK and download the libcompat
	package from:
	http://packages.opendarwin.org/mpkgs/devel/libcompat-4.6.2-RELEASE.mpkg
	
	Once this is done, update your profile to set the environment variable DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
	with /opt/local/lib which is the default location when installing this package.


4 - Install GNU tar:

	The version of tar presently installed on Mac OS X does not support our large
	directory structure. So in order to extract the archive below, you need to install
	GNU tar. It can be downloaded from

	http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/tar/tar-1.13.tar.gz

	Then you can type the following commands as a root user:

	tar xvfz tar-1.13.tar.gz
	cd tar-1.13.tar.gz
	cp /usr/share/automake-1.6/config.* .
	./configure
	make
	make install

	Then `tar' should be installed in /usr/local/bin. So make sure to update your PATH
	environment variable. To ensure this is the correct tar version, typing

	tar --version

	should output the following:

	tar (GNU tar) 1.13

Then you can extract the file Eiffel53.tgz using:

tar xvfz Eiffel53.tgz

Then to make your install useable you need to initialize the libraries by going
in the Eiffel53 directory and type:

find . -name \*.a -exec ranlib {} \;

Then read the install normal instruction located in $ISE_EIFFEL/INSTALL.
