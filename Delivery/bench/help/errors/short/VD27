Lace error: There is an inconsistency between the Root clause 
  of the Ace file and the creation clause of the system's root 
  class
What to do: 
  1) If the system's root class has a creation procedure: make 
     sure that the name listed in the Root clause is that of a 
     feature which is a creation procedure of the root class
  2) If the system's root class does not have a creation procedure: 
     make sure that that the Root clause does not list a creation 
     procedure.
