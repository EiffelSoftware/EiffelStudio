	description: "[
					Compile the C files generated by a `compile_melted' or
					`compile_frozen' instruction.  Note that `compile_melted' can
					result in freezing if there are external routines.  The
					optional <output-file-name> specifies the name of the file in
					the output directory $OUTPUT into which output from this
					compilation will be written, so that it can potentially be
					compared with a known correct output file.  If
					<output-file-name> is omitted, compilation results are written
					to a file with an unadvertised but obvious name (which could
					possibly change) in the output directory.
