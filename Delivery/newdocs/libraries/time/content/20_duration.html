<h1>Duration</h1>

<p><a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a>, <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> AND <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME_DURATION</span></a></p>
<p>The classes dealing with duration inherit DURATION, which inherits
GROUP_ELEMENT and PART_COMPARABLE. An instance of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a>, <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> or
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME_DURATION</span></a> is an element of a group, i.e. there is a zero and addition operations (infix +,
infix -, prefix + and prefix -). Duration is used as an amount of time, without link to an origin. It may be added to the
respective absolute notion (time + time_duration is possible, not time + date_time_duration nor date_time +
time_duration...see classes <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time.html"><span class="eclass">TIME</span></a>, <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date.html"><span class="eclass">DATE</span></a> and <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME</span></a>).</p>
<p>Attributes are allowed to take negative values or values which do not stand
in the usual range (hour = -1, minute = 75, day = 40...). However, features are available in each class to
convert instances into the usual format: functions canonical and to_canonical are present in each class. An instance
is canonical (canonical = True) if its attributes stand into the usual range. For example, an instance of
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a> such as 12:-10:60 is not canonical. to_canonical will return 11:51:0. In <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> and
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME_DURATION</span></a>, these features are also present.</p>
<p>The order is partially implemented. <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a> has a complete order
whereas <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> and
 
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME_DURATION</span></a> are more specific.</p>
<b>
<h2>TIME_DURATION</h2>
</b>
<h4>Creation</h4>

<p>Two ways are possible: by choosing the value of each attributes hour, minute
and second (feature make), or by giving an amount of seconds (make_by_seconds). Any integer value is
accepted. It is possible to create a duration with 1 hour and -60 minutes.</p>

<h4>Access</h4>

<p>Zero is a once feature with 0 hour, 0 minute and 0 second. The total amount
of second of the current duration is the result of feature seconds_count.</p>

<h4>Comparison</h4>

<p>Instances of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a> may be compared easily. The order is the order of
the respective total amount of second. 1:-40:0 is less than 0:0:1800, etc... Functions &lt;, &gt;,
&lt;= and &gt;= are available. Is_equal tests equality, = will compare references.</p>

<h4>Element change</h4>

<p>Set directly hour, minute and second with set_hour, set_minute and set_second.
Arguments do not need to satisfy any range rule.</p>

<h4>Operations</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Adding hours, minutes and seconds with features hour_add, minute_add and
    second_add.</li>
  <li> <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a> inherits from GROUP_ELEMENT. infix and prefix +, infix and
prefix - are available to compose instances of each other.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conversion</h4>

<p>Two features ensure a link with the notion of day: to_days returns the number
of days equivalent to the current duration. For example, a duration such as 23:60:0 is equivalent to
one day. For negative duration, the result is never 0. -1 hour is equivalent to -1 day (i.e. the result of the function is
- 1). To_days is associated with time_modulo_day. This second function returns an instance of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a>.
The result represents the difference between the current duration and the number of days yielded by to_days. It
implies that the result is always positive and less than one day.</p>
<p>For example, the current duration is 25:70:600. to_days will returns 1 (one
day) and time_modulo_day will return 2:20:0:. If the current duration is negative: -23:-80:300,
to_days will return -2 (minus two days) and time_modulo_day will return 23:45:0.</p>
<p>Durations may be canonical or not canonical (BOOLEAN canonical). That means
the features hour, minute and second are included in a particular range, or not. An instance of
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a> is canonical if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>in the case of a positive duration (&gt; zero), all of the three features
have to be positive or 0, minute and second less than 60.</li>
  <li>in the case of a negative duration (&lt; zero), all of the three features
have to be negative or 0, minute and second strictly greater than -60. The function canonical tests if the duration is
canonical or not, the function to_canonical yields a new duration equivalent to the current one and canonical.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DATE_DURATION</h2>

<p>Dealing with the gregorian calendar is not so easy because of irregularities.
A duration of one month may be equal to 28 up to 31 days, depending on the current date! On the other
hand, it could be useful to deal with precise duration. This point leads to an original design of the class: A
separation is made between two kinds of instances.</p>
<p>The definite ones and the relative ones. The function definite which returns
a BOOLEAN, is true for definite duration and false otherwise. An instance is definite if and only if its attributes
month and year are 0. Then only the number of days is used. Relative (non definite) durations have their
attributes year, month and day meaningful but it is then impossible to compare them to each other (is one month greater
than 30 days?, is one year greater than 365 days?). The main difference appears when a duration is added to a date.
In the case of a definite duration, there is no ambiguity. A given number of days are added to the date, taking care of the
calendar. In the other case, the result is relative to the origin date. For example, a one month duration may be
equal to 28 days if the date is in February or 31days if the date is in August. A duration becomes definite when its
attributes year and month become 0. However it is possible to deal with instances of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> without taking care of
this distinction.</p>

        <h3> Relative date_duration</h3>

<p>Relative duration can not be compared with any other durations (including
zero). The reason is simple.
 
It is not possible to say if 30 days are less than 1 month: it depends on the
date: it is true in August (in a 31 days month) and it is false in February.</p>
<p>If feature &gt; (or &lt;, + + is called with at least one non definite member
(the current instance or the argument), the result will be always False. We may only know if two durations are equal,
with the feature is_equal. It compares field by field the two durations. When adding a relative date_duration to a
date, the years and the months are added first, then the date may be cut (June 31 -&gt; June 30) and finally the days are
added. For example, if one month is added to the date August 31st, the result is September 30th.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there is a way to compare relative durations: a relative
date_duration may be canonical. It means that the duration has its attributes month and day in a fixed range.
month must be between 1 and 12, and day larger than 1 and less than a value between 27 and 30. This value is fixed
simply: (in the case of a positive duration) when setting day to 0 and adding one more month, the addition of the start
date and this new duration must yield a date strictly after the final date (yielded by adding date and tested
duration). For example is 0/0/30 (i.e. 0 year, 0 month and 30 days) canonical?</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the origin date is 01/15 (15th of January), the final date is 02/14. We
can not convert 30 days into 1 month in this case. The duration is canonical.</li>
  <li>If the origin date is 04/15 (15th of april), the final date is 05/15. The
duration is not canonical since it is possible to convert days into 1 month. The origin date is used to determine whether the duration is positive or not.
If the final date is after
 
the origin date the duration is positive, otherwise it is negative. That does
not mean we can compare it to zero, that is
 
only used to determine the sign of the canonical standard. If the duration is
negative, it is canonical only if all the
 
attributes are negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>A way to compare two relative durations is to make them canonical from the
same date, and then to compare the fields. It is the same as adding the durations to the same date,
and to compare the final dates to each
 
other.</p>

        <h3>Definite date_duration</h3>

<p>Definite durations are characterized by the attribute day. Whenever a
duration has its attributes year and 
month equal to 0, this duration is then definite. On the other hand, if one
of these two attributes is not 0, the duration is not definite anymore.</p>
<p>The number of days between an origin date and the result of (date + duration)
does not depend on the origin date. It is possible to compare definite date_duration to each other.
The order is the one of day.</p>
<p>A definite duration may be canonical or not. It is canonical if the number of
day is small enough.</p>

<h3>General description</h3>
<h4>Creation</h4>

<p>Two creation features are available: make takes three arguments (year, month
and day). If year and
 
month are null, the duration will be definite; make_by_days takes only the
number of day. The duration is
 
automatically definite.</p>

<h4>Comparison</h4>

<p>Features &lt;, &gt;, &lt;= and &gt;= are available. If both instances are
definite, numbers of days are compared. If one of them is non definite, the result is False.</p>

<h4>Element change</h4>

<p>Features set_day, set_month and set_year are available to set one of these
three attributes day, month, year.</p>

<h4>Operation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Add years, months and days with features year_add, month_add and day_add.</li>
  <li> <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> inherits from GROUP_ELEMENT. infix and prefix +, infix and
prefix - are available to compose
 
instances of each other.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conversion</h4>

<ul>
  <li>to_canonical is used to get a new duration equivalent to the current one
and canonical. It needs an argument from
 
class <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date.html"><span class="eclass">DATE</span></a>, which is the origin of calculations.</li>
  <li>to_definite is used to get a new duration equivalent to the current one and
definite. As with the previous feature,
 
one argument is needed. - to_date_time is used to get an instance of
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME_DURATION</span></a>. It will have the
 
same date of the current duration and time set to zero.</li>
</ul>
<b>
<h2>DATE_TIME_DURATION</h2>
</b>
<p><a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME_DURATION</span></a> is client of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> and <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a>. Most of the
common features described in <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a> are present in the class. The class deals
with its attributes date and time in
 
the same way as <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME</span></a>.</p>
<p>There are, as in <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a>, definite and non definite durations. It is
the date part which gives the definite non definite status. Features canonical and to_canonical are present in
DATE_TIME_DURATION. They have to deal with the attributes time.</p>

<h4>Creation</h4>

<p>There are still several ways to create an instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>by choosing values for all the attributes of date and time (make). - by
choosing a value for day and values for all the attributes of time. The instance is then definite
    (make_definite).</li>
  <li>by gathering an instance of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date.html"><span class="eclass">DATE</span></a> with an instance of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time.html"><span class="eclass">TIME</span></a> (make_by_date_time).
This feature copies the
 
references of its arguments, so that if the time (or the date) is changed,
the instance previously initialized will be also
 
changed. If this effect has to be avoided, the use of clones is required.</li>
  <li>by encapsulating an instance of <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date.html"><span class="eclass">DATE</span></a> (make_by_date). The attribute time is
set to zero, i.e. 0:0:0. The
 
attribute date is set with the same reference than the argument.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Access</h4>

<p>Seconds_count is the amount of seconds of the time part only. To get the
total amount of seconds of the cur-rent
 
duration, first shift it to a definite duration, then multiply day by the
number of seconds in day and add
 
to it seconds_count. Take care that the duration is not more than 68 years.
If it is, the number of seconds will
 
be larger than 2 billion, which is the upper limit for INTEGER (4 bytes).</p>

<h4>Comparison</h4>

<p>The rules are the same than those for <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a>. Features &lt;, &gt;,
&lt;= and &gt;= are available. If both instances are definite, numbers of days are compared. If one of them is
non definite, the result is False.</p>

<h4>Element change</h4>

<p>It is possible to change reference of time and date with the features
set_time and set_date. To change only
 
one element (for example hour), features from <a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a> or <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a>
have to be used.</p>

<h4>Operation</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME_DURATION</span></a> inherits from GROUP_ELEMENT. infix and prefix +, infix
and prefix - are available
 
to compose instances to each other.</li>
  <li>Only day_add is present. To add only one element, features from
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/time_duration.html"><span class="eclass">TIME_DURATION</span></a> or <a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_duration.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_DURATION</span></a>
 
have to be used.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conversion</h4>

<ul>
  <li>canonical and to_canonical are available in the class. To be canonical an
instance of the class must have its
 
attributes time and date canonical. Then time must have the same sign than
the one of the current duration. The sign of
 
the current instance is determined by adding it to the argument (from
<a href="/libraries/time/reference/date_time.html"><span class="eclass">DATE_TIME</span></a>). That will yield a final
 
date. If this final date is after the origin (= the argument), the current
duration is considered positive. Otherwise,
 
it is considered negative. Finally time must be less than one day (if
positive) or more than minus one day (if negative). 
To_canonical returns a duration equivalent to the current one (for the
argument) and canonical.</li>
  <li>time_to_canonical looks like to_canonical but focuses mainly on time. It
requires a definite duration so that it 
is possible to compare it to zero. It yields a definite duration equivalent
to the current one with a canonical time. hour 
is then cut so that it stands in the range of one day (0 to 23 if positive
and -23 to 0 if negative). The attributes day is 
also modified to keep the result equivalent to the current duration.
time_to_canonical does not need any argument 
because only time and day are modified.</li>
</ul>
