test_name 	 ext-with-alias-new-cluster
test_description A system with a class which has an external routine with an alias compiles fine and is correctly frozen even if only melting is requested.  Then the Ace is changed so that the class containing the external routine is found in a different (newly added) cluster with a new cluster tag, but the class text is identical.
