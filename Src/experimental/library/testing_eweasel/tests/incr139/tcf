-- This is a test control file
-- NOTE: originally the test tried to change the Precursor you were calling by a rename but the compiler
-- should have rejected this with a VDPR(3) error. Now it does but the code does not check for the change
-- in renaming anymore.

test_name 	 rename-get-new-precursor
test_description A class calls a routine and the routine calls its precursor but should report a VDPR(3) error. Fixing the error should yield for the proper output.
