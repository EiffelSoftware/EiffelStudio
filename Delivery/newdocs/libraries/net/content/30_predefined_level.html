		<H1>The predefined level</H1>
        <p>Many client-server applications follow a standard scheme that relies
        on the facilities outlined so far. When your application conforms to
        this scheme, you can avoid most of the work by relying on the client and
        server classes of the predefined level. There is no need to consider
        sockets explicitly or to worry about synchronization.</p>
        <p>As in many other cases found in the ISE Eiffel 5 libraries, the
        object-oriented method makes it possible here to encapsulate the
        standard pattern found in most usual cases.</p>
        <h3>The predefined client and server classes</h3>
        <p>The classes of the predefined level, which only support stream
        communication (not datagrams), are <a href="../reference/abstract/client_server/client_chart.html">CLIENT</a>,
        <a href="../reference/abstract/client_server/server_chart.html">SERVER</a>,
        and their descendants <a href="../reference/local/client_server/unix_client_chart.html">UNIX_CLIENT</a>,
        <a href="../reference/local/client_server/unix_server_chart.html">UNIX_SERVER</a>,
        <a href="../reference/network/client_server/network_client_chart.html">NETWORK_CLIENT</a>
        and <a href="../reference/network/client_server/network_server_chart.html">NETWORK_SERVER</a>.
        All the architecture of a client-server application is already available
        through these classes. All you have to do is to specify the address you
        want to use, what you want to send, when you want to send it, and what
        you want to do when you receive data. The rest will be taken care of
        automatically.</p>
        <p>The UNIX_<i> </i>classes are meant for systems running on the same
        machine, using <a href="../reference/local/socket/unix_stream_socket_chart.html">UNIX_STREAM_SOCKET</a>;
        the NETWORK_<i> </i>classes support inter-machine communication, using <a href="../reference/network/socket/network_socket_chart.html">NETWORK_SOCKET</a>.</p>
        <h3>Using the client classes</h3>
        <p>When you want to write an application, your client should inherit
        from <a href="../reference/local/client_server/unix_client_chart.html">UNIX_CLIENT</a>
        for example, and in your creation procedure, you have to setup your
        address, and then call the inherited make routine, with your address as
        an argument. You are then provided with some send and receive routines.</p>
        <h3>Using the server classes</h3>
        <p>For the server, you inherit for example from <a href="../reference/local/client_server/unix_server_chart.html">UNIX_SERVER</a>.
        In the same way as for the client, you set up your address in the
        creation procedure, and then call the <i>make</i> creation procedure
        inherited from <a href="../reference/local/client_server/unix_server_chart.html">UNIX_SERVER</a>.
        After that your creation procedure should call <i>execute</i>, which is
        inherited from <a href="../reference/abstract/client_server/server_chart.html">SERVER</a>,
        and provides you with a loop calling <i>receive</i>, <i>process_message</i>,
        <i>respond</i> and <i>clean_up</i>. Then, you should redefine these
        routines to do what you want your server to do.</p>
