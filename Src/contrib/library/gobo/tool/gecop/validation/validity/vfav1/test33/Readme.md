# Validity VFAV-1

This [test](.) is exercising the condition [1](../Readme.md) of the validity rule [VFAV](../../vfav/Readme.md).

### Description

In this test, class `BB` has a feature `f` with the alias name `alias "+"`, and it inherits feature `g` from `CC` renamed as `h` with the same alias name. The operator `+` is binary in both cases. This violates `VFAV-1`.
