					Interface of EiffelStudio encoding converter with encoding detection.

					Encoding detection priority:
					1. If `a_encoding' is attached, use it as the encoding of `a_file'
					2. Detect BOM from `a_file', use the detected encoding.
					3. Use the encoding specified in the context of `a_class' (.ecf)
					4. Default to ASCII (ISO-8859-1) encoding.
