<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>While working on a project, you may want to launch it to see if it behaves as
expected, and if not to find out where the problem is located. 
<p>There are several ways to launch the application you are working on from
EiffelStudio:
<ul>
	<li><A HREF="30_run_a_finalized_executable.html">Run a finalized executable</a>, where no debug is possible.
	<li>Launch an application and enable its debugging
	<ul>
		<li><A HREF="10_run_and_debug.html">Launch and stop</a> as soon as the application encounters 
		a <A HREF="../20_breakpoints/00_introduction.html">breakpoint</a>
		<li><A HREF="20_run_without_breakpoints.html">Launch and do not stop</a> when encountering breakpoints
	</ul>
	<li>Execute one step in the application
	<ul>
		<li><A HREF="40_step_into_a_feature.html">Enter a feature</a>
		<li><A HREF="50_step_by_step.html">Execute one line</a>
		<li><A HREF="60_step_out.html">Exit a feature</a>
	</ul>
</ul>


<p>Once the application is launched in debug mode, you can <A HREF="70_pause_execution.html">stop</a> it at any time
to see its current state or you can <A HREF="80_kill_application.html">kill</a> it completely.</p>


<p>All these commands are accessible either through the <b>debug</b> menu, or through
the <b>project</b> toolbar.</p>
