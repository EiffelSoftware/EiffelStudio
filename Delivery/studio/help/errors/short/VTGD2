Error: You are trying to do a generic derivation with a type
  parameter which does not conform to the corresponding constraint.
What to do: Make sure that in a generic derivation of base class
  `EXAMPLE[G->COMPARABLE]' the actual type parameter conforms to the constraint.
  As an example: `EXAMPLE [INTEGER]' is valid because `INTEGER' conforms to
  `COMPARABLE'.
