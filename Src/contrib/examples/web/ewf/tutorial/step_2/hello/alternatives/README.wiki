This folder contains 2 alternatives code

1) "message" using the WSF_MESSAGE_EXECUTION interface, i.e
	message: WSF_RESPONSE_MESSAGE
		do
			...
		end


2) "launcher" using the WSF_RESPONSE_SERVICE interface, but it uses a launcher to start the service, instead of inheriting from WSF_DEFAULT_SERVICE
