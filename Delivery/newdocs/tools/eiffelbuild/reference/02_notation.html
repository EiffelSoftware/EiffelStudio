		<H1>EiffelBuild Notation</H1>
		<P> This page contains descriptions of terms found within the EiffelBuild documentation.
		<A NAME="object"></A><H2>Object</H2>
		<P> An EiffelBuild object is a representation of a Vision2 component and its properties. When developing with EiffelBuild, you manipulate objects to build the desired interface.</P>
<P>Each object type has a different set of properties that may be manipulated, and these correspond directly to
the properties available within the <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/00_introduction.html">EiffelVision2</A> type. There is property which is specific to an EiffelBuild object, <B>Name</B> which is used for your identification purposes and as the attribute name in the generated code.</P>
<P>
For more information on manipulating objects within EiffelBuild, see:
	<UL>
		<LI>How to <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/how_to_s/20_create_an_object/index.html">create an object</A></LI>
		<LI>How to <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/how_to_s/50_reparent_an_object/index.html">reparent an object</A>.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/40_object_editor/index.html">Object editor</A> for details on modifying object properties.</LI>
	</UL>
</P>
<P> Within EiffelBuild, there may be multiple views of a single object displayed simultaneously. Any modifications to an object will immediately update all views. Both the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/20_layout_constructor/index.html">layout constructor</A> and the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/60_builder_window/index.html">builder window</A> provide views of the objects within your project, and in these, the objects may be manipulated. The <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/50_layout_window/index.html">display window</A> also provides a view of the objects in your system, except the objects cannot be manipulated from this view. It can be thought of as a preview of the project you are developing. The <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/64_window_selector/index.html">window selector</A> shows representations of all window and dialog objects currently in the system.</P>
		<A NAME="component"></A><H2>Component</H2>
		<P>EiffelBuild components are templates representing user defined object structures. From a component, you can quickly build a matching structure of objects. Components are available in EiffelBuild so that you do not repeatedly create the same structures over and over again while developing your projects.</P><P>You specify a new component by creating it from an existing object structure. See <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/63_component_selector/index.html">component_selector</A> for more detailed instructions on the use of components.</P>
<P>To view an existing component, use the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/65_component_viewer/index.html">component_viewer</A>.</P>
<P>It is not possible to modify a component once created, except to <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/63_component_selector/index.html#delete_component">delete</A> it.</A>
		<A NAME="pick_and_drop"></A><H2>Pick and Drop</H2>
		<P>The pick and drop mechanism is one of ISE's exclusive technologies and is provided by <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/00_introduction.html">EiffelVision2</A>. In EiffelBuild, it allows you to easily send data from a component of the interface to another.</P>
<P>You can <B>Pick</B> a reference to a <b>development object</b>, such as an object or component with a single click of the <b>right</b> mouse button. Then as you start moving the mouse around - not pressing any of its buttons - a pebble tracks the cursor position, and a line continuously connects the pebble to the object's original position.</P>
<p>You may terminate this situation in either of two ways:
	<ul>
		<li>If the pebble you are dragging is the regular cursor, you can right-click again to confirm the pick-and-drop
		and so effectively send the dragged development object to the targeted component. This is known as <B>Dropping</B>.	<p>Right-clicking when the pebble is the <B>no</B> cursor, will only stop the
        pick-and-drop because the component you are
        hovering with the
		mouse does not accept your development object.	<li>If, for any reason, you change your mind, you can cancel the pick-and-drop by left-clicking anywhere
		or by pressing the Escape key.
	</ul></p>
