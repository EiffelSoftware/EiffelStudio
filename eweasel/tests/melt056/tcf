test_name 	melted-expanded-like-current
test_description A system has a call whose target is of an expanded type `expanded FOO', where class FOO is not declared as an expanded class.  The call is to a function whose return type is `like Current'.  Melting the system works fine but when the system is executed it dies with a segmentation fault.  Frozen code works fine.
