A class CHILD has an inheritance clause `TEST1 [CHILD]', which should
elicit a VTUG(2) error.  Instead, the compiler reports a VTCG error in
the generic constraint of a different class.  But in order to discover
the VTCG violation, the compiler should have had to analyse CHILD
enough to detect the VTUG error, which is the real problem.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
