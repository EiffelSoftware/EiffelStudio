		<h1>Revisions and bug fixes</h1>
		<p>This document contains details of modifications and bug fixes to the vision2 
			library listed by the release version of EiffelStudio. All bug fixes and 
			modifications are relative to the previously released version.</p>
		<h2>Eiffel Studio 5.3</h2>
		<p><b>Interface modifications</b></p>
		<ul class="circle">
			<li>
				<B>EV_TITLED_WINDOW_ACTION_SEQUENCES</B>
			added which is inherited only by EV_TITLED_WINDOW and provides three new action 
			sequences :- `minimize_actions', `maximize_actions' and `restore_actions'.
			<li>
				<b>EV_TITLED_WINDOW</b>
				<ul class="square">
					<li>
					 You may now only call `maximize' and `minimize' if `is_show_requested'.
					<li>
						When minimized, `is_displayed' now returns False.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>
				<B>EV_BUTTON</B>
			now inherits EV_FONTABLE, allowing you to modify the font displayed.
			<li>
				<B>EV_DYNAMIC_LIST_ITEM</B> - Corrected `off' which was using the version 
				inherited from EV_TREE_NODE when it should have been using the version from 
				EV_TREE_NODE_LIST instead.</li>
			<li><B>EV_RECTANGLE</B> - Added precondition to `intersects' which stops a Void rectangle being passed as an argument.</li>
			<li><B>EV_TOOL_BAR_SEPARATOR</B> - Now export many inherited features to {ANY} instead of {NONE}, including `parent'.</li>
			<li><B>EV_ENVIRONMENT</B> - Added `supported_image_formats' which returns a LINEAR [STRING] containing all valid formats by their three letter extension.</li>
			<li><B>EV_CHECKABLE_LIST</B> - New class added which behaves as an EV_LIST, except that for each EV_LIST_ITEM contained, an associated check box is displayed.</li>
			<li><B>EV_MESSAGE_DIALOG</B> - No longer deferred, and has two creation procedures `default_create' and `make_with_text'.</li>
			<li><B>EV_STANDARD_DIALOG</B> - All descendents now have `make_with_text' as a creation procedure'</li>.
			<li><B>EV_TABLE</B> - Now inherits CHAIN instead of ARRAY. This is a breaking change, and may require some modification to your code. The inheritence from ARRAY was seriously flawed. For example, if you were to call `extend' on an EV_CONTAINER object that was currently referencing an EV_TABLE, then this would fail. Now that we inherit CHAIN, this problem, among others of a similar nature are fixed. Another advantage of inheriting CHAIN, is that the table may now be iterated which allows for greater flexibility.<br><br>The following list details some of the breaking changes, and how to fix them:
				<ul>
					<li><B>item</B> - If you were using `item', you should change this to `item_at_position'. A call to `item' will now return the current item.</li>
					<li><B>put</B> - If you were using `put', you must now replace this with `put_at_position'.
					<li><B>extend</B> and <B>replace</B> - These are now both exported, as before, they were exported to {NONE}.</li>
					<li>features inherited from <B>ARRAY</B> - These are no longer available, but the feature `item_list' is available, which returns the table represented as an ARRAYED_LIST [WIDGET].</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Bug fixes</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Platform independent</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>EV_WIDGET</b> - `pointer_style' now correctly returns the Ibeam cursor for 
						textable widgets.</li>
					<li><B>EV_FIGURE_RECTANGLE</B>
						<ul class="square">
							<li>Corrected `bounding_box' which was previously computed incorrectly when the rectangle was rotated.</li>
							<li>Fixed `width' and `height' which were always returning one less pixel than they should have.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<li>
				<b>Windows</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>EV_PIXMAP</b>
					- Setting a tile with `set_tile' followed by a call to a fill routine would 
					crash the implementation.
					<li>
						<b>EV_COMBO_BOX</b>
					- Implemented pick and drop.
					<li>
						<b>EV_TEXT_FIELD</b>
					- Implemented pick and drop.
					<li>
						<b>EV_PASSWORD_FIELD</b>
					- Implemented pick and drop.
					<li>
						<b>EV_TEXT</b>
					- Implemented pick and drop.
					<li>
						<b>EV_DRAWABLE</b>
					- Fixed bug when you performed the following: drew a filled shape, called 
					`set_tile' and then drew another filled shape. The tile would not be used on 
					the second fill.
					<li>
						<b>EV_COLOR_DIALOG</b>
					- Querying `color' after a user had cancelled the dialog would previously crash 
					a system, if `set_color' had never been called.
					<li>
						<b>EV_COLOR</b>
					- Fixed `set_rgb_with_24_bit' which would fail when called.
					<li>
						<b>EV_BUTTON, EV_TOGGLE_BUTTON</b> - The buttons now correctly display a text, 
						pixmap and background color simultaneously. Previously, the background color 
						was never displayed, and either the pixmap or text would be displayed, not 
						both.</li>
					<li>
						<b>EV_TEXT</b> - If not `is_editable' and a `background_color' had been set, it was only used on lines containing text. The `background_color' is now correctly displayed throughout the whole control when not `is_editable'.</li>
					<li><b>EV_PRINT_DIALOG</b> - Fixed `set_from_page' and `set_to_page' which were previously not implemented.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>
				<b>Gtk</b></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Eiffel Studio 5.2</h2>
		<p><b>Interface modifications</b></p>
		<ul class="circle">
			<li>
				<b>EV_TEXTABLE</b>
			- `align_text_left', `align_text_right' and `align_text_center' have been 
			extracted into a new class, EV_TEXT_ALIGNABLE which inherits EV_TEXTABLE. All 
			previous descendents of EV_TEXTABLE now inherit EV_TEXT_ALIGNABLE, except 
			EV_TREE_NODE, EV_MENU_ITEM, EV_LIST_ITEM and EV_TOOL_BAR_BUTTON
			<li>
				<b>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</b>
			- Now inherits EV_TEXTABLE.
			<li>
				<b>EV_TEXT_ALIGNMENT_CONSTANTS</b>
			- New class added to support EV_TEXT_ALIGNABLE.
			<li>
				<b>EV_MENU_ITEM_LIST</b>
			- `parent' is now of type EV_ANY, instead of EV_MENU_ITEM_LIST as it did not 
			hold for EV_MENU_BAR. The renaming of `parent' to `old_parent' in EV_MENU_BAR 
			has now been removed.
			<li>
				<b>EV_VIEWPORT</b>
			- added `set_item_width', `set_item_height' and `set_item_size'.
			<li>
				<b>EV_TABLE</b>
				<ul class="square">
					<li>
					redefined `prunable' to `True' and implemented `prune'.
					<li>
						Added the following features - `set_item_span', `set_item_position', 
						`set_item_span_and_position', `area_clear_excluding_widget', `item_row_span', 
						`item_column_span', `item_row_position' and `item_column_position'.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>
				<b>EV_WIDGET</b>
			- Changed type of `focus_in_actions' and `focus_out_actions' from 
			EV_FOCUS_ACTION_SEQUENCE to EV_NOTIFY_ACTION_SEQUENCE. `is_parent_recursive' is 
			no longer available. It has been moved to EV_CONTAINER. This was necessary to 
			fix a catcall encountered using vision2 under .NET. The problem manifested with 
			widgets that held items.
			<li>
				<b>EV_FIGURE</b>
			- `proximity_in_actions' and `proximity_out_actions' are now obsolete.
			<li>
				<b>EV_FONTABLE</b>
			- `set_font' now sets a copy of the font internally.
			<LI>
				<b>EV_TREE</b>
			- `ensure_item_visible' and `has_recursively' now take an EV_TREE_NODE as 
			arguments, instead of an EV_TREE_ITEM.
			<li>
				<b>EV_TEXT</b>
			- `put_new_line' is now obsolete. Use `set_text ("%N") instead."
			<li>
				<b>EV_APPLICATION_ACTION_SEQUENCES</b>
			- Added `cancel_actions', fired when a pick and drop is cancelled, and 
			`pnd_motion_actions' fired while the pointer moves during a pick and drop.
			<li>
				<b>EV_TREE_NODE_LIST</b>
				<ul class="square">
					<li>
					`find_item_recursively_by_data', `has_recursively' and `recursive_do_all' are 
					now implemented in this class, instead of both EV_TREE and EV_TREE_NODE which 
					are descendents.
					<li>
						Added `retrive_items_recursively_by_data' and 
						`retrieve_item_recursively_by_data' which allow you to specify a comparison 
						criterion, and due to this addition, `find_item_recursively_by_data' has now 
						been made obsolete.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>
				<b>EV_DYNAMIC_LIST</b>
			- Added `retrieve_item_by_data' and `retrieve_items_by_data'.
			<li>
				<b>EV_ITEM_LIST</b>
			- Made `item_by_data' obsolete, as you should now use `retrieve_item_by_data' 
			added in EV_DYNAMIC_LIST.
			<li>
				<b>EV_DIALOG</b> - Added `is_relative' and defined `is_modal' in this class, 
				instead of inheriting it from EV_WINDOW.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Bug fixes</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Platform independent</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>EV_FIGURE_POLYLINE</b>
						- Fixed `start_angle' and `end_angle' so that they are computed relative to the 
						first and last polyline segments. This also fixes the start and end arrows, so 
						that when displayed, they now actually point in the direction of their 
						respective line segments.
						<li>
							<b>EV_TREE and EV_TREE_NODE</b>
						- Fixed `find_item_recursively_by_data' which failed on the `index_not_changed' 
						postcondition. Note that these features are now defined in EV_TREE_NODE_LIST.
						<li>
							<b>EV_DYNAMIC_TREE_ITEM</b> - Fixed invariant violation from EV_ITEM_LIST, when 
							created with `default_create'.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					<b>Windows</b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>EV_RADIO_BUTTON</b>
						- The default minimum height after `default_create' is now enough to display 
						the widget correctly.
						<li>
							<b>EV_CHECK_BUTTON</b>
						- The default minimum height after `default_create' is now enough to display 
						the widget correctly.
						<li>
							<b>EV_NOTEBOOK</b>
						- When removing a widget from a notebook, it is now visible. Previously, the 
						widget would be hidden.
						<li>
							<b>EV_LIST, EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST, EV_TREE</b>
						- Fixed `set_foreground_color' and `set_background_color'. Previously, calling 
						these features did nothing.
						<li>
							<b>EV_BOX</b>
						- If a widget was not`is_item_expanded', then adding a new widget to the box 
						before that widget would sometimes cause a different widget to become 
						`is_item_expanded'.
						<li>
							<b>EV_TOOL_BAR_RADIO_BUTTON</b>
						- The currently selected button in `peers' was unselected when the button was 
						pressed, and not when it was really selected. This bug made it possible to make 
						`selected_peer' Void, which caused an invariant to fail.
						<li>
							<b>EV_LIST_ITEM</b>
						- Calling `enable_select' when parented in an EV_LIST now also sets the item as 
						focused in the parent. This corrects bugs in keyboard navigation when selecting 
						an item programatically.
						<li>
							<b>EV_FIXED</b>
						- The minimum size is constrained by the positions and sizes of the children 
						(They must be completely displayed), although when the positions of the 
						children were reduced, the minimum allowable size was not recomputed. This 
						meant that the widget would be enlarged when the positions of the children 
						increased, but could never be reduced in size when the positions of the 
						children were decreased.
						<li>
							<b>EV_MENU and EV_MENU_ITEM</b>
						- `set_pixmap' has been implemented as previously, it did nothing.
						<li>
							<b>EV_TABLE</b>
						- re-implemented resizing calculations to fix numerous problems when children 
						had minimum sizes. The minimum size now also includes the border width when 
						empty.
						<li>
							<b>EV_NOTEBOOK</b>
						- `selection_actions' were called when you selected an item through 
						`select_item', even if the item was already selected. `selection_actions' are 
						now only fired when the selection changes.
						<li>
							<b>EV_TREE_ITEM</b>
						- calling `set_pixmap' twice successively with the same EV_PIXMAP caused a 
						postcondition failure.
						<li>
							<b>EV_TEXT</b>
						- Fixed `put_new_line', although it has been made obsolete, as you should just 
						use `append_text ("%N") instead.
						<li>
							<b>EV_SPLIT_AREA</b>
						- Fixed crash reproducable by inserting an EV_PIXMAP directly into the split 
						area.
						<li>
							<b>EV_CONTAINER</b>
						- Fixed `propagate_foreground_color' and `propagate_background_color' which 
						failed when one of the children was a descendent of EV_CELL.
						<li>
							<b>EV_APPLICATION_ACTION_SEQUENCES</b>
						- `drop_actions' was being fired even when the pick and drop was cancelled.
						<li>
							<b>EV_PIXMAP</b>
						- Previously, if you were to add an agent to an action sequence of the pixmap, 
						before it was parented, the agent would be removed during the parenting.
						<li>
							<b>EV_MENU</b>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Pruning an EV_MENU_SEPARATOR when one or more EV_RADIO_MENU_ITEM were still 
								contained in the menu would cause occasional crashes.
								<li>
								Previously, when adding an EV_MENU_SEPARATOR, followed by multiple 
								EV_RADIO_MENU_ITEMS, all the items were being selected.
								<li>
									Fixed bug in `destroy' which was causing postcondition failures.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>
							<b>EV_TITLED_WINDOW</b>
						- Fixed a GDI leak, manifesting when a window was destroyed.
						<li>
							<b>EV_DIALOG</b>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Fixed `is_modal' which was previously always returned `False'.
								<li>
								Fixed bug with `background_color' and `foreground_color' which was not taken 
								into account if the dialog was shown relative or modally to another window.
								<li>
								If a dialog with a default cancel button was displayed using `show', then 
								minimizing the dialog would cause the system to fail internally.
								<li>
								Fix bug in `show_relative_to_window' which would cause any associated menus to 
								be removed.
								<li>
								Fixed bug in `show', as if the dialog had already been shown modelessly to a 
								window, then calling `show' did not show it independently, but still 
								modelessly.
								<LI>
								Fixed bug with `show_actions' which would be wiped out if you called 
								`show_modal_to_window' and then `hide'.
								<LI>
									`set_pixmap' will now actually display the pixmap, whereas before, no pixmap 
									was displayed.</LI>
							</ul>
						<li>
							<b>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</b>
						- Fixed `text_length' which was returning incorrect value for all descendents.
						<li>
							<b>EV_TEXT</b>
						- Fixed `line_count' which was previously returning the correct result + 1.
						<li>
							<b>EV_SCROLLABLE_AREA</b>
						- Fixed crash which occurred when you attempted to use `set_x_offset' or 
						`set_y_offset' before the area had been parented or displayed.
						<li>
							<b>EV_FONTABLE</b>
						- Fixed bug when `font' was queried, `preferred_families' was not returned 
						correctly, and would always be empty.
						<li>
							<b>EV_CONTAINER</b> - `set_background_pixmap' was not correctly cloning the 
							image of the pixmap, and the displayed image could then be modified after 
							setting, by changing the image of the original pixmap.</li>
					</ul>
				<LI>
					<b>Gtk</b>
				</LI>
				<UL>
					<LI>
						Remaining EV_WIDGET memory leaks have been fixed.</LI>

			<li>
				<b>EV_TREE and EV_TREE_NODE</b>
			- Added `recursively_do_all'.
			<li>
				<b>EV_STANDARD_DIALOGS</b>
				<ul class="square">
					<li>
					`ok_actions' have been renamed in descendents where appropriate. e.g. in 
					EV_PRINT_DIALOG, they are renamed to `print_actions' to match the texts of the

					obsolete.
					<li>
						Selected button now also returns the correct text of the button (Previously it

				</ul>
			<li>
				<b>EV_DIALOG_CONSTANTS</b>
			- Added new constants required for the above change to EV_STANDARD_DIALOGS.
			<li>
				<b>EV_DRAWABLE</b>
			- `draw_straight_line' now has a precondition to ensure the points are not 
			identical.
			<li>
				<b>EV_SPLIT_AREA</b>
			- seperated `put' from `extend'. They were defined as synonyms, but have 
			different behaviour.
