A class has a generic parameter G of type XXX with a generic creation
clause `create default_create end'.  It also has a creation
instruction whose target is an attribute of type G.  If XXX is a
deferred class, the compiler should report a VGCC(1) error but it does
not.

Discovered in release 5.3.0612.
