After initial compilation where the system is melted, an entity name
in a class invariant is changed to the name of a nonexistent entity.
When the compiler reports the VEEN error, the entity name is changed
back to its original value and compilation completes.  But execution
of the resulting system, which was compiled with `assertion (all)',
does not monitor class invariants.  It does monitor all other
assertions.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
