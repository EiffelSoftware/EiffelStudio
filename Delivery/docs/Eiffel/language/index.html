Welcome to the on-line introduction to the Eiffel method and language.
This material was derived from chapter 1, <EM>An Invitation to Eiffel</EM>,
of the book
<A HREF="/doc/documentation.html#etl">
Eiffel: The Language
</A>,
the official reference on Eiffel, published by Prentice Hall and
available from bookstores as well as from ISE and its distributors.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time an extensive Eiffel introduction has been made available on line
and we hope you will find it useful.
</P>
<P>
Be sure to look at the other on-line documents, in particular
to the indispensable complement to this overview of the language and method:
the
<A HREF="/doc/manuals/bench/tour/index.html">introduction to EiffelBench</A>, ISE's acclaimed graphical development environment for
Eiffel.
Check also for
<A HREF="/doc/manuals/index.html">other manuals</A> frequently
being added, and for information about
<A HREF=/doc/documentation.html>books and other documentation</A> on
Eiffel and related topics.
