test_name	 benchmark-scoop-gc-tree-processor-creation
test_description Benchmark for tree-like creation of processors. The test is controlled by command-line arguments, and the execution time in seconds is printed on completion. It is not safe to start more than the maximum number of processors if the arity is greater than 1 because existing processors may be waiting for creation of new ones and cannot be freed.
