test_name 	 expanded-pass-current
test_description A non-expanded class FOO has a routine `bar' which passes Current to a routine which uses it to set an attribute in the object referenced by the passed argument.  Another class declares an entity of type `expanded FOO' and calls `bar' on it.  The attribute in this entity is changed by the call, though it should not be.
