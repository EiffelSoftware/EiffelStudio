	Struct used to implement 'deep_twin' and 'is_deep_equal'.
	It is used to keep track of already traversed objects.
	The struct is using linear traversing. A better implementation could use a hash-table.
	'from' contains the objects already twined, or already compared.
	'to' contains, at the same index, their twined version, or the object to which they are equal.
	'from' and 'to' are made up of chunks. They point to the chunk being filled.
	Other chunks (already filled) are linked together using index 0.
	Indexes from 1 to capacity store actual Eiffel objects.
