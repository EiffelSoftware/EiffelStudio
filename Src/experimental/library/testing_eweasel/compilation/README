To install EiffelWeasel
=======================

In the following UNPACK_DIR is the directory where you put the
distribution file eweasel.tar.gz.  INSTALL_DIR is the directory
where you want to install EiffelWeasel.

1. Unpack the distribution:

	[Put eweasel.tar.gz in UNPACK_DIR]
	
	cd UNPACK_DIR
	gunzip eweasel.tar.gz
	cd INSTALL_DIR
	tar xvf UNPACK_DIR/eweasel.tar

   Creates eweasel directory tree in INSTALL_DIR.

2. Set EWEASEL environment variable:

	setenv EWEASEL INSTALL_DIR/eweasel

   eweasel is the main EiffelWeasel directory that has sub-directories
   source, bin, and so forth.
   
   For me, this is

	setenv EWEASEL /marten/eweasel

3. Repeat this step once for each platform on which you want to
   install EiffelWeasel:

   Make sure ISE_EIFFEL and ISE_PLATFORM environment variables
   are set correctly for the platform.
   
   Execute the eweasel compilation shell script:

	$EWEASEL/compilation/install_eweasel  [-keep]

   This compiles all C code needed by EiffelWeasel, builds library
   eweasel.a in platform-specific directory, compiles EiffelWeasel
   itself (finalizes it) in platform-specific directory, compiles the
   generated C code and copies the executable to:

	$EWEASEL/spec/$ISE_PLATFORM/bin/eweasel

   If you do not specify the "-keep" option, all *.o files and the
   entire EIFGEN tree from compiling eweasel are deleted at the end.



To run EiffelWeasel
===================

Make sure the following environment variables are correctly set:
	
	EWEASEL
	ISE_EIFFEL
	ISE_PLATFORM

Set the following csh alias (or equivalent in another shell):

	alias ew '$EWEASEL/spec/$ISE_PLATFORM/bin/eweasel -d HOME /home/dhollen -d INCLUDE $EWEASEL/control -d EWEASEL $EWEASEL -d ISE_EIFFEL $ISE_EIFFEL -d ISE_PLATFORM $ISE_PLATFORM -d VERSION 5.2 \!* $EWEASEL/control/init $EWEASEL/control/catalog /marten/test'

In the above alias, you'll need to change "/home/dhollen" to your home
directory (not sure if this is used for anything).  You must also
change "/marten/test" to the output directory you want to use
(directory where tests are executed).

If you want to use a different version of the compiler, just change
the value of the $ISE_EIFFEL and/or $ISE_PLATFORM environment variables.
   
You can then run tests with commands like:

	ew -f 'test generic-zero-parms'		Run test generic-zero-parms
	ew -k -f 'test generic-zero-parms'	Also keep output directory
	ew -f 'kw pass'			Run all tests with keyword "pass"
	ew 				Run all tests

Before running any of the tests, you'll need a precompiled EiffelBase.
You should create it by copying the file eiffelbase_precomp.ace in
this directory to $ISE_EIFFEL/precomp/spec/$ISE_PLATFORM/base/Ace.ace
and then precompiling EiffelBase.

Please contact me if you have any problems or if you have any
questions about how EiffelWeasel works.
