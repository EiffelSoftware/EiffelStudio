test_name 	 rescue-recurse-many-retries
test_description A routine which conditionally raises an exception has a rescue clause which always retries, but which first calls the routine itself recursively the first time the rescue clause is executed.  Executing the system with garbage collection off causes a run-time panic if the number of retries is moderately large (331 or greater).
