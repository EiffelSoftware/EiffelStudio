The mission or goal of MSYS is to provide a minimal POSIX environment for 
configuring and building MinGW ports and code.  The MSYS developers have taken 
the Cygwin source and modified it to fit the needs for MinGW and MSYS.  The very
minimum of binaries needed to provide an efficient means to natively configure
and make is what the developers have strived to distribute.  Therefore they do
not encourage the use of MSYS as a runtime.
