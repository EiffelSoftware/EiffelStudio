	description: "[
		An interface of an executor taking a list of tests and queues them to later be run and determined
		whether the implementation under test has passed or failed the test.
		
		When a executor is launched it will first go into preparation state. The executor represents a
		collection of tests which are simply the tests provided as the argument. The collection is
		synchronised with the test suite. This means when a test is changed or deleted in the test suite,
		the executor will adopt its own collection. During the actual testing, the execution will simply
		iterate through the list of tests and remove each item once it starts testing it.
		
		See {EIFFEL_TEST_PROCESSOR_I} for details on the execution flow.
