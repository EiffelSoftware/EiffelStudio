Attributes declared as unique and introduced in the same class are
supposed to all have different values according to page 266.  But
unique attributes added to an existing unique declaration can
sometimes get the same value as an existing unique attribute when

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
Actually, it now causes a PANIC and core dump.
