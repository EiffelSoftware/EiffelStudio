    Validity: Inline Agent Requirements

    An Inline_agent a must satisfy the following conditions:

        1 No formal argument or local variable of a has the
          same name as a feature enclosing class, or a formal
          argument or local variable other than Result of an
          feature or Inline_agent.

        2 Every entity appearing in the Attribute_or_routine
          part of a is the name of formal argument of a;
          a local variable of a; a feature of the enclosing
          class.

        3 The Feature_body of a's Attribute_or_routine is
          not of the Deferred form.

        4 No formal argument or local variable of a has the
          same name as a feature of the enclosing class.
