Finalizing a system whose root creation procedure is an inherited
(rather than immediate) feature produces C code which won't link.  It
does not matter whether the Ace includes any `visible' clauses for the
involved classes.  Even turning off dead_code_removal does not help.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
