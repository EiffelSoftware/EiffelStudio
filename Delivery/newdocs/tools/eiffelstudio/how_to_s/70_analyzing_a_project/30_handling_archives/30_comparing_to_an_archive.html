		<H1>Comparing to an archive</H1>
		<p>The main goal of archives is comparing archives one to another. In
        order to compare your project to an archived file, you must have clicked
        on <img border="0" src="/images/eiffelbench/icon_delete_small_color.gif" width="16" height="16">
        in the &quot;metric&quot; tab of the context tool.</p>
		<p>The goal is to load the archive of a (preferably different) project,
        to compare the archived measures to the system's. You can either select
        a file that is located on your machine or a remote one, using a URL
        address.</p>
		<p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelbench/Metrics_png/archive_compare.png" width="279" height="526"></p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the &quot;Set reference archive&quot; frame, select the
            comparison mode. Comparison can be displayed in one of the following
            mode:<br>
            - Ratio of current measures to the archived one.<br>
            - Ratio of the difference between current and archived measures to
            current measures.<br>
            - Value of the archived measures.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><br>
        If you want to access a remote archive:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Enter the URL address in the &quot; Current archive&quot; field.
            Address must include either a http or a ftp protocol.</li>
          <li>Press the carriage return (enter) key.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you already have the archive file on your machine:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click on &quot;Browse&quot;.</li>
          <li>Select the archive file you want your system to be compared to.</li>
        </ol>
		<p>In both cases, exit the main interface (on clicking &quot;OK&quot;)
        to make your comparison effective. Comparison results are displayed in
        the last column of the multi column list in the &quot;Metric&quot; tab
        of the context tool, regarding the comparison mode you have previously
        chosen.</p>
