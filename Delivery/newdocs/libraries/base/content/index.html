		<P>
			EiffelBase, covered by the open-source <A HREF="../../../general/licenses/iffel.html">IFFEL license</A>,
			is one of the principal	contributions of Eiffel: a library of fundamental structures
			and algorithms covering the basics of computing, and resulting from a "Linnaean"
			effort at a general-purpose taxonomy of computing structures. EiffelBase is one
			of the most carefully designed and extensively used libraries in the object-oriented
			industry.
		<P>
			The EiffelBase library include:
			<UL>
				<LI>A <A HREF="kernel.html">Kernel</A> that defines the core classes of all Eiffel systems.</LI>
				<LI>A <A HREF="structures/index.html">Data Structures</A> cluster including classes for all the major data structures (sets, lists, tables etc...)</LI>
				<LI>A <A HREF="support.html">Support</A> cluster that provide access to the environment, basic math operations and a few other helper classes.</LI>
				<LI>A <A HREF="desc.html">Dynamic External Shared Call</A> mechanism to call functions in DLL at runtime (Windows specific).</LI>
