		<H1>Generating executables</H1>
		<P>There are several ways to compile an executable with EiffelStudio.<P>Compilation
        modes include the following: melting, freezing and finalizing. To learn
        more about the compilation semantics in EiffelStudio, see the
        <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/30_compiler/00_introduction.html">compiler reference</A>.
        <p>There is a command for all compilation modes in the <b>Project</b> menu, under
        the entries <b>Melt</b>, <b>Freeze </b>and <b>Finalize</b>. There is
        also a <b>Quick compile</b> command, that only melts the classes that
        have been edited in EiffelStudio since the last compilation. You may
        want to use it as long as no classes are edited outside EiffelStudio.</p>
        <p>These commands are also available in the <b>Project</b> toolbar

        <p>To solve the errors that occur during the Eiffel compilation, use the
        <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/70_wizards_and_dialogs/30_dialogs/20_error_description/00_introduction.html">compilation error wizard</a>. For errors occurring during the C compilation,
        check that the installation is not corrupted (all environment variables
        should be set, especially ISE_C_COMPILER and ISE_PLATFORM), and refer to
        your C compiler documentation for more information.</p>
