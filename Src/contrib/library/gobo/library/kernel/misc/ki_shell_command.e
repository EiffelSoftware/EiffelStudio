feature -- Execution

	execute is
			-- Ask operating system to execute `command'. Wait until
			-- termination. Make exit status available in `exit_code',
			-- `is_user_code' and `is_system_code'.
			-- (Note that under Windows 95/98 the exit status code
			-- returned is always 0 when `is_user_code' is true.)
