test_name 	 vmfn-new-deferred-ancestor
test_description After initial compilation where the system is melted, a deferred routine effected by an attribute is changed to a constant attribute. When the VMFN error is reported, it is changed back to a deferred routine and compilation finishes normally.  Then a new class with a deferred version of the routine is inherited and called with dynamic type Current.  After changes are melted, execution ends with a segmentation fault.
