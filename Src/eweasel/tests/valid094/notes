A class with an inheritance clause which renames some inherited
features violates either VHRC(2) or VHRC(3) and also violates VHRC(1)
is not reported as violating VHRC(1).  It seems to me that it should.
If `old_name' is not the final name of a feature of the named parent,
then `old_name' is not even valid.  This seems like a more fundamental
error than renaming a valid feature name more than once or renaming a
valid feature name to itself.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
