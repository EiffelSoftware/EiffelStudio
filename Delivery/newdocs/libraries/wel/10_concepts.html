		<P>This document details some useful concepts within WEL.<P>
		<H2>Inheriting <A HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/support/wel_application_chart.html">WEL_APPLICATION</A>.</H2>
		<H2>Redefining <A HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/support/wel_application.html#f_main_window">main_window</A>.</H2>
		<H2>Common message hooks.</H2>
			<P>Each WEL library component implements a set of routines for processing the most common messages that a component
			receives.	For example, looking at <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="../reference/windows/wel_frame_window_chart.html">WEL_FRAME_WINDOW</A>, you will see that
			there are many features which begin `on_'	. Each of these features enable the user to know when a specific event has
   	   		occured, and to perform the appropriate processing as a result of this event.
   	   		Most of the time, you will only be interested in a small subset of these, necessary to your program.
   	   		For example, below is the code for <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/windows/wel_composite_window.html#f_on_paint">on_paint</A>:<br><br>
			<code>
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">on_paint</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol"> (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="elocal">paint_dc</SPAN>:
	        <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/gdi/wel_paint_dc_chart.html">WEL_PAINT_DC</A><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="elocal">invalid_rect</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">: </SPAN><A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/structs/wel_rect_chart.html">WEL_RECT</A><SPAN CLASS="esmbol">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword"> is</SPAN><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">--Draw a centered text</SPAN><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>
			</code>
			<P>An on_paint message corresponds to the Wm_paint message generated by windows whenever it needs to re-paint a window, and if you look at the feature, you can see that the arguments are a <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/gdi/wel_paint_dc_chart.html">WEL_PAINT_DC</A> and a <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/structs/wel_rect_chart.html">WEL_RECT</A>.
			which are relevent to this message. By redefining this feature (and others as required), your code will be able to respond appropriately to windows events.
			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>. See <A HREF="/libraries/wel/samples/tutorial/index.html">tutorial</A> <A HREF="/libraries/wel/samples/tutorial/step3/index.html">step3</A> for a demonstration involving the re-definition of <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/windows/wel_composite_window.html#f_on_paint">on_paint</A>.</p> 
			<P>For different messages received by a control, the arguments will differ (sometimes there are none), but those arguments will always be relevent to the message. 
			For example, <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/windows/wel_composite_window.html#f_on_menu_command">on_menu_command</A> from <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/windows/wel_composite_window_chart.html">WEL_COMPOSITE_WINDOW</A>
			has an <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/base/reference/kernel/integer_chart.html">INTEGER</A> as an argument, the value of which is a unique menu identifier.<br>
			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>. Not all windows events have a corresponding on_* message hook defined in WEL. If you wish to process a message from windows that does not correspond to one of the available features, you will need
			to redefine <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/wel/reference/windows/wel_window.html#f_process_message">process_message</A></p>
