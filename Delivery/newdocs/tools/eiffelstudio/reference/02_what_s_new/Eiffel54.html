		<H1>What's new in EiffelStudio 5.4</H1>
		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
		<h3>Improvements</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>Added support for mouse wheel in editor and associated 
          parameterization in preferences.</li>
          <li>Cluster tree is not collapsed anymore between compilation.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>Fixed issue where setting the string background color to `auto' in 
          the preferences will set it to a black color next time your relaunch 
          EiffelStudio.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue where typing in an empty features tree will close down 
          EiffelStudio.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue with BON diagram where expanded client links were not 
          properly displayed (the expanded bar was drawn on top of classes 
          instead of on the link itself).</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Compiler</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click
          <a href="../30_compiler/60_version_history/04_54_release/00_53_to_54_changes.html">here</a> 
          for the compiler release notes.</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Libraries</h2>
        <h3>Eiffel2Java</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed incorrect memory freeing in <span class="efeature">get_string</span> in <span class="eclass">JNI_ENVIRONMENT</span> 
          that could cause some memory corruption.</li>
          <li>Fixed <span class="eerror">VDRD</span> error in <span class="efeature">method_id</span> from <span class="eclass">JAVA_OBJECT</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelBase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimized <span class="efeature">i_th</span> from <span class="eclass">PRIMES</span> for 
          the first 200 prime numbers.</li>
          <li>Fixed bug in <span class="efeature">generic_typecode</span> from <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span> in .NET implementation 
          which fixed an issue with <span class="efeature">is_reference_item</span>.</li>
          <li>Made <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span> a descendant of <span class="eclass">HASHABLE</span> 
          and defined <span class="efeature">hash_code</span> (based on the hash_codes of the 
          elements of a <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span>).</li>
          <li>Added <span class="efeature">default_create</span> as creation procedure of <span class="eclass">
          TUPLE</span> and made <span class="efeature">make</span>
          obsolete.</li>
          <li>Added convenience features to <span class="eclass">TUPLE</span>: <span class="efeature">put_XX_item</span> where `XX' can be 
          replaced by `character, boolean, integer, double,...'.</li>
          <li>Optimized <span class="eclass">ROUTINE</span>, <span class="eclass">PROCEDURE</span> and <span class="eclass">FUNCTION</span> 
          implementation to speed up agent calls by a factor of 2 to 3. Removed 
          <span class="efeature">open_operand_type</span> from <span class="eclass">ROUTINE</span> as its specification was only used 
          internally and specification was not precise enough to be used by 
          clients of <span class="eclass">ROUTINE</span>.</li>
          <li>Fixed <span class="efeature">set_directory</span> from <span class="eclass">PATH_NAME</span> on Windows so that it will append a `\' if 
          needed before appending the directory name.</li>
          <li>Fixed <span class="efeature">append</span> from <span class="eclass">SEQUENCE</span> to not perform a
          <span class="efeature">deep_clone</span> when passed 
          argument is the same reference as Current. This was a problem when the 
          base class of the type of the elements inherited from <span class="eclass">MEMORY</span> and 
          redefined <span class="efeature">dispose</span>. You could possibly end up freeing twice an external 
          resource.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelNet</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bug in <span class="efeature">set_delay</span> and <span class="efeature">set_nodelay</span>
           in <span class="eclass">NETWORK_STREAM_SOCKET</span>, because their implementations were inverted.</li>
          <li>Fixed incorrect spelling of <span class="efeature">
          maximum_seg_size</span> in <span class="eclass">NETWORK_STREAM_SOCKET</span>.</li>
          <li>Added recoverable storable to EiffelNet (was not included in 
          previous version although recoverable storable was available for 
          files)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelTime</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved speed of <span class="eclass">DATE</span> and <span class="eclass">TIME</span> comparison.</li>
          <li>In <span class="eclass">DATE_VALUE</span> added 
          <span class="efeature">ordered_compact_date</span> and made <span class="efeature">compact_date</span> 
          obsolete.</li>
          <li>In <span class="eclass">DATE </span>added <span class="efeature">make_by_ordered_compact_date</span> and 
          made
          <span class="efeature">make_by_compact_date</span> obsolete.</li>
          <li>In <span class="eclass">DATE_VALIDITY_CHECKER</span> added <span class="efeature">ordered_compact_date_valid</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelThread</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Added support for .NET</li>
          <li>Made <span class="eclass">OBJECT_OWNER</span> obsolete</li>
          <li>Added <span class="efeature">wait_with_timeout</span> in <span class="eclass">CONDITION_VARIABLE</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelVision2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <a href="../../../../libraries/vision2/content/0-_revisions/index.html">
          Click here to see list of update and modification to EiffelVision2</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>WEL</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Renamed <span class="efeature">convert</span> from <span class="eclass">CONVERTER</span> class into
           <span class="efeature">extract_definition</span>.</li>
          <li>Renamed <span class="efeature">convert</span> from 
          <span class="eclass">WEL_FONT_FAMILY_ENUMERATOR</span> class into <span class="efeature">update_current</span>.</li>
			<li>In <span class="eclass">WEL_TREE_VIEW</span>, calling <span class="efeature">deselect_item</span> will now really deselect the item, whereas previously, it only caused the item to be redrawn without selection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>.NET libraries</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Renamed <span class="eclass">THREAD</span> and <span class="eclass">MUTEX</span> into <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_THREAD</span> and <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_MUTEX</span> to 
          avoid name conflicts with EiffelThread.</li>
        </ul>
