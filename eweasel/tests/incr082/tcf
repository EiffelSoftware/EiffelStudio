test_description The "Hello weasel" program compiles and executes fine with `assertion (all)' and no precompiled cluster.  Then file "string_8.e" is excluded from the kernel cluster.  After the VD23 errors are reported, the exclude clause is removed and compilation completes.  System is re-executed.
