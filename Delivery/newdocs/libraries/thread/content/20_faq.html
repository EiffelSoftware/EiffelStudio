<H1>Multithread FAQ</H1>
<h3>I've launched several threads and they do not seem to be executed:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The thread that launched the several threads may be dead before its
  children.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Two threads can lock the same mutex, however none of them unlocks it:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Same problem as above. Maybe the first thread that locked the shared mutex
  died before the second tried to lock it: thus, the first one
  automatically unlocked it when it died. You should put a join_all or an infinite
  loop in the parent thread.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>I've added the option multithreaded in the project settings and it crashes:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you have already compiled your system in non-MT mode, you cannot change
  the mode of compilation and simply relaunch your compilation
  (the generated C-code would be incompatible). Delete all your object files in
  your W_code or F_code directory and freeze or finalize the system again.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>My once function changed during my MT-Eiffel-program:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The once functions are once per thread in Multithreaded mode. Hence, each
  once function is thread-specific and is initialized the first time it is
  called in a thread.</p>
  <p>You can create a once per process by following <a href="/technologies/threads/20_once_features.html">these
  instructions</a>.</p>
