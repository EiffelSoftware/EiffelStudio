		Represents a freshly retrieved collection.
		The collection items are stored as strings, no matter if they are a basic value or a foreign key.
		Every collection item is also attached to the class name of its generating class as well.
		A NULL value in the database is represented as an empty string, and the class name of a NULL value is `NONE'.
