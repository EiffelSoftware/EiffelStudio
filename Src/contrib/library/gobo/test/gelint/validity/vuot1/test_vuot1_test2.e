		"Test for validity rule VUOT-1"

	remark: "[
		In this test two object-tests with the same local `x' appear in the
		same expression. This is not forbidden by ECMA yet:

		ECMA 367-2, section 8.24.3 p.127: "Validity: Object Test rule"
		Validity code: VUOT-1
		An Object_test 'ot' of the form '{x: T} exp' is valid if and only if
		it satisfies the following conditions:
		1. 'x' does not have the same lower name as any feature of the enclosing
		   class, or any formal argument or local variable of any enclosing feature
		   or Inline_agent, or, if 'ot' appears in the scope of any other Object_test,
		   its Object-Test Local.

		But in the agenda of ECMA meeting on 6 March 2009, it is suggested that
		it would be also forbidden to have two object-tests with the same local
		name appearing in the same expression to avoid scope intersection (i.e.
		two object-tests with the same local name and whose scopes can overlap)
		as shown in the current test.
