After initial compilation, a class header is modified so that the
class is expanded.  The system is recompiled without incident, but
when it is executed, an attribute which is now of an expanded type
does not get initalized properly (creation procedure of expanded class
is not called).

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
