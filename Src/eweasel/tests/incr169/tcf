test_name 	 change-created-actual-generic
test_description A class inherits from a generic class which has a routine that creates an entity of the generic type and prints its generating type.  After initial compilation where the system is melted, the printed result is correct.  Then the type of the actual generic is changed from STRING to SEQ_STRING and changes are melted.  Execution then produces the wrong result (the same result as before).
