A precompiled library includes a cluster whose tag is `foo', which
contains a class TEST.  An Ace file that uses this precompiled library
also includes a cluster with tag `foo' that has its own class TEST,
but this cluster has a different path.  The compiler should report a
VDCN error but does not.

Discovered in release 5.4.0610.
