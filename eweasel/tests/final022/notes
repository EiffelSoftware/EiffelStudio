A generic class `TEST1 [G]' has a routine `value2: G is do end'.  If
the actual generic parameter is an expanded class, then `value2'
returns Void when the system is finalized with inlining, but should
not.  Melted code, frozen code and finalized code without inlining
work correctly.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
