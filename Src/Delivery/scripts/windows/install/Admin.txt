------------------------

1.1.1 Require Properties

There are a number of variables that *have* to be set to install successfully. These are detailed below:

    - C_CONFIG_NAME       : Either "msc", for using a preinstalled Microsoft C/C++ compiler or "mingw" to install and use GCC.
                            NOTE: GCC can only be used for the x86 version of EiffelStudio.

    - PID                 : For Enterprise editions of any installer a personal identifier is require, which is in the form of a CD-KEY for the
                            installing application. For GPL/Free Trial installations this information is not required.

1.1.2 Optional Properties
