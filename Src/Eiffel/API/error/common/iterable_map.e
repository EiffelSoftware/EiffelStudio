	description: "[
			An iterable based on another one whose items of one type are mapped to values of another type with a specified function.
			First parameter specifies a type of elements in the original iterable structure.
			Second parameter specifies a type of elements returned by this iterable structure.
			
			Example. The following expression produced an iterable with a sequence of two values: "no" and "yes":
				
					create {ITERABLE_MAP [BOOLEAN, STRING]}.make
						(agent (v: BOOLEAN)
							do
								Result := if v then "yes" else "no" end
							end,
						<<false, true>>)
		]"

class ITERABLE_MAP [G, H]

inherit
	ITERABLE [H]

create
	make

feature {NONE} -- Creation

	make (map: FUNCTION [G, H]; other: ITERABLE [G])
			-- Associate iteration with `other' which elements are to be transformed using `map'.
		do
			target := other
			mapping_function := map
		ensure
			target = other
			mapping_function = map
		end

feature -- Access

	new_cursor: ITERATION_CURSOR [H]
			-- <Precursor>
		do
			create {ITERABLE_MAP_CURSOR [G, H]} Result.make (mapping_function, target.new_cursor)
		end

feature {NONE} -- Access

	target: ITERABLE [G]
			-- Original structure to be iterated over.

	mapping_function: FUNCTION [G, H]
			-- Function to tranform elements of the original structure `target' to elements of the desired type {H}.
