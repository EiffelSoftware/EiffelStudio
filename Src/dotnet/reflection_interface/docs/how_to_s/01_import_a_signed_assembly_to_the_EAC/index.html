			<h1>How to import a signed assembly to the Eiffel assembly cache?</h1>
		</center>
		<br>

		<p>
				To import an assembly to the Eiffel assembly cache, you have to make sure the assembly is signed.
		</p>
		<p>
				If your current screen is the <a href = "../../reference/01_imported_assembly_viewer.index.html">imported assembly viewer</a> (the first window when you launch ISE Assembly Manager), you first have to open the <a href = "../../reference/60_import_tool/index.html">import tool</a> by clicking on the following toolbar button <img src = "../../images/import_tool_toolbar_button.png" no border> or selecting the menu item `Import Tool' in the `Tools' menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			 	Depending on the "kind" of assembly you want to import, you will follow two different shemes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>To import a signed assembly, which is in the Global Assembly Cache:</b></li><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the name of the shared assembly you want to import (in the array listing all shared assemblies)</li>
				<li>Click on the following toolbar button <img src = "../../images/import_dialog_toolbar_button.png" no border> or select the menu item `Import' in the `Tools' menu. In both cases, the <a href = "../../reference/70_import_dialog/index.html">import dialog</a> will appear and guide you to import the selected assembly to the Eiffel assembly cache.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<li><b>To import a signed assembly, which is in not in the Global Assembly Cache:</b></li><br>
			<p>
				Click on the open toolbar button <img src = "../../images/open_assembly_toolbar_button.png" no border> or select the menu item `Open Assembly' in the `File' menu. In both cases, the <a href = "../../reference/80_open_assembly_dialog/index.html">open assembly dialog</a> will appear. You just have to select the signed assembly you want to import and click on `Open' to open the <a href = "../../reference/70_import_dialog/index.html">import dialog</a>, which will guide you to import the selected assembly to the Eiffel assembly cache.
			</p>
		</ul>
