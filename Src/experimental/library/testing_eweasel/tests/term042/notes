A class which inherits a deferred feature `feat' once from one class
and an effective feature `feat' with the same signature twice from a
second class (as both `feat' and `renamed_feat') and also redefines
`feat' so that its return type is anchored to `renamed_feat' causes
silent termination of the compiler after pass 1.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
