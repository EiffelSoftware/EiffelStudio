        <p>In order to facilitate the creation of C dynamic libraries using
        EiffelStudio, a wizard helps generate the definition files used to
        define the contents of the shared library. If for some reason you need
        to override the wizard, the <A HREF="20_definition_file_syntax.html">syntactic rules</A> of the definition files are
        available, but they are not necessary to know to make a standard use of
        the dynamic library generation in EiffelStudio.</p>
        <p>The wizard is accessible in the <b>Tools</b>/<b>Dynamic library
        builder</b> menu.</p>
        <p>The dynamic library window that appears when selecting this menu is
        mainly composed of a list which contains all features that should be
        exported. This list is course empty at first.</p>
        <p>SCREENSHOT(DLL window)</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: The layout of this wizard is slightly different on
        Windows and on Unix systems, because the index and calling convention
        fields never appear on Unix systems.</p>
        <p>To add a new feature to the definition file, you can either:</p>
        <UL>
        	<LI>
        Pick the feature from any place in EiffelStudio and drop it into the
        list. If several creation procedures exists in the container class, a
        dialog is popped up to give the choice between all possible creation
        procedures.
        	<LI>
        Or, use the Add command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_add_exported_feature_color.gif"> in the <b>Edit</b>/<b>Add</b> menu.
        This pops up a dialog where it is possible to enter manually all parameters
        for the exported feature. SCREENSHOT(Add exported feature dialog)
        </UL>
        <p>Other commands of the <b>Edit</b> menu allow you to remove 
        <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_remove_exported_feature_color.gif"> exported
        features or to modify their export parameters <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_edit_exported_feature_color.gif">.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to check the validity of the definition file.
        This command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_check_exports_color.gif"> performs
        both a global check, to ensure that for example two features do not have
        the same name or same index in the library, and also local checks, that
        check for each feature that the parameters are valid.</p>
        <p>Other commands, located in the <b>File</b> menu, give standard file
        operations, such as opening  <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_open_file_color.gif">
        a definition file, creating a new definition
        file  <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_dynamic_lib_color.gif">,
        or saving the current definition file  <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_save_color.gif">.</p>
        <p class="tip"><b>Tip</b>: Although the wizard can handle several files during the
        same EiffelStudio session, remember that only one file can be used in
        the project settings to effectively generate a shared library.</p>
