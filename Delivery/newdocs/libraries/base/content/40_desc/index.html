					<P>
						The DESC mechanism enables you to construct objects representing external
						routines determined at execution time through their name and libraries, and
						call these routines with the appropriate arguments.</p>
					
					<p CLASS="note"><b>NOTE</b>: The libraries containing the routines determined at
					runtime are unmanaged (non-.NET) libraries. .NET libraries (also known as
					assemblies) can be accessed directly using project references.</p>
						
					<P>
						Two classes, <A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A> and
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine_chart.html">DLL_32_ROUTINE</A>
						, supported by an auxiliary class
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_constants_chart.html">
						SHARED_LIBRARY_CONSTANTS</A> provide the basis for DESC under Windows:</p>
						
					<UL>
						<LI>An instance of class
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A> describes
						a 32-bit Dynamically Linked Library. This class is a descendant of the deferred
						class <A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_chart.html">
						SHARED_LIBRARY</A>, covering the platform-independent notion of shared
						library.</li>
						
						<LI>An instance of class
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine_chart.html">DLL_32_ROUTINE</A>
						describes a routine from a 32-bit DLL. Predictably, this class has an attribute of type
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A> describing the
						library to which the routine belongs. It has a deferred ancestor
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_routine_chart.html">
						SHARED_LIBRARY_ROUTINE</A> capturing the platform-independent notion of
						shared library routine.</li>
						
						<LI><A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_constants_chart.html">
						SHARED_LIBRARY_CONSTANTS</A> introduces a few declarations useful for
						dealing with shared libraries and routines, in particular a few integer constants
						describing error codes and type codes. It is an ancestor to both of the preceding
						classes; application classes using DESC can also inherit from it to gain access
						to its facilities.</li>
					</UL>
					
					<P>
						The basic sequence of instructions to use the DESC mechanism is the following:</p>
						
					<OL>
						<LI><A HREF="library.html">Create</A> a library object (an instance of
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A>, providing the
						library's name as argument to the creation procedure.</li>
						
						<LI><A HREF="routine.html">Create</A> a routine object (an instance of
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine_chart.html">DLL_32_ROUTINE</A>
						), providing the library object, the routine's name or index in the library, and the
						routine's signature - number of arguments, types of arguments, type of result
						if any - as arguments to the creation procedure.</li>
						
						<LI><A HREF="routine_call.html">Apply</A> procedure
						<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine.html#f_call">call</A>
						to the routine object, passing an array that contains the actual arguments
						required by the external routine.</li>
					</OL>
					
					<P>
						Each of these steps may be repeated as often as necessary to use multiple libraries,
						multiple routines in a library, or multiple calls to a given routine.</p>
