RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX-GLIBC VERSION

This note does not apply to any version other than Linux ELF format. 

This version of ISE Eiffel was built using the 2.0.32 version of the kernel
using glibc-2.0.6 and elf format.


0) PLATFORM environment variable
--------------------------------

Please note that the PLATFORM environment variable is now linux-glibc instead of
linux-elf.


1) Glibc
--------
This release is compatible with GNU C library based Linux systems.
The glibc systems has to have libc5 libraries to be able run the executables.
If you develop under a glibc system, your applications will be using the 
GNU C library.

The new linux-glibc release is compatible with the linux release in 
non multithreaded mode. In MT-mode the executables running on `linux'
platforms using libc5 do not work on `linux-glibc' platforms. 

All the C libraries libMel.a, libmtMel.a, libnet.a, libmtnet.a, and those in
$EIFFEL5/bench/spec/linux-glibc/lib are compiled with glibc. 

The precompiled base library is also compiled with glibc. MEL and
EiffelVision precompiled libraries are not provided for glibc. You can use
the one from precomp/linux (make links from base!, mel and vision precomp
libraries to precomp/linux-glibc). You can also precompile them yourself.

The binaries are compiled with libc5.

Please read $EIFFEL5/Release_notes/spec/linux/README file for more
information.
