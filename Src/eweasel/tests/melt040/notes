A call to a routine which is implemented as an infix operator
sometimes gives the wrong results when the formal argument is of a
heavier type than the actual argument (e.g., formal is DOUBLE and
actual is REAL).  Also, in some cases passing a REAL to a REAL formal
argument does not give correct results.  In some cases, frozen and
melted code give different results.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
