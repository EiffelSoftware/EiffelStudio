		<paragraph>Now that we have defined all basic notions such as metrics. metric hierarchy and scopes, let us see how the metric tool can help in evaluating a project.</paragraph> 
		<paragraph>Many commands are provided in the tool to compute measures and handle them. Indeed, it is possible to calculate metrics, save measures in order to retrieve them later on, request details for a given measure when available and eventually delete a set of measures.</paragraph> 
		<paragraph>To perform a measure, you simply choose a metric and a scope, and request the computation, by clicking the "calculate" button. This operation allows to evaluate the selected metric over the selected scope. The measure is displayed in the provided text field, but it is not saved yet.</paragraph> 
		<paragraph>To multi-column list displays the recorded measures. To save a measure, click on the "Add &amp; save" button. The last calculated measure appears in the multi-column list and is saved in a file automatically generated by the interface. The file is located in the Metric subfolder of the current project location.</paragraph> 
		<paragraph>For "big" scopes (in the sense of the total ordering previously defined) details are sometimes available concerning the evaluated metric, and then the "detail" button is sensitive. It displays measures resulting from applying the requested metric over all smaller scopes.</paragraph> 
		<paragraph>It is possible to remove some measures after having saved them thanks to the "delete" button. Measures will be removed both from the multi-column list and from the file they were saved in.</paragraph> 
		<paragraph>After having recompiled a project, the recorded measures may no longer be accurate. The icon

			</image> to inform users that measures have been calculated before the last recompilation, and therefore may be obsolete. Updating measures is possible by right clicking on the multi-column list and choosing an item from the context menu. Measures will be updated both in the multi-column list and in the file they were saved in.
