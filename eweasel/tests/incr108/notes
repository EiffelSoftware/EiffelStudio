When a class with a postcondition containing the assertion `(old (old
Result)' is compiled, the compiler correctly reports a syntax error.
But when the extra parenthesis is removed, the compiler issues a
VEEN(22) error (local entity may not be used in this context) naming
the entity `y'.  It should instead report a VEEN(2) error (illegal use
of Result).  If the class is compiled from scratch, a VEEN(2) error is
correctly reported.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
