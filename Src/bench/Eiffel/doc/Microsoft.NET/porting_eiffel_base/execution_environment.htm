<h1>EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<h2>Used .NET classes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>ENVIRONMENT
</ul>
<h2>Static methods used</h2>
<ul>
	<li>{ENVIRONMENT}.get_current_directory, set_current_directory, get_environment_variable
</ul>
<h2>Security notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Need unrestricted permission to get the current directory.
	<li>Need unmanaged code to set the current directory.
	<li>Read permission is needed when accessing the Path environment variable.
</ul>
<h2>Unhandled exceptions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If the directory doesn't exist in set_current_directory, DirectoryNotFoundException is raised.
	<li>When trying to set the current directory to a Void or empty string, exceptions are raised too.
</ul>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>.NET doesn't seem to provide a way to set environment variables, so that 
	"user_environment_variables" was added to store additional environment variables.
	Of course these variables won't be accessible by {ENVIRONMENT}.get_environment_variable.
	<li>Do not support home directories by default.
	<li>Needed to include some system.dll classes (PROCESS, PROCESSSTARTINFO)
      =&gt; TODO
</ul>
