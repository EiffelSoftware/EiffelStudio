        <H2>What's new</H2>
        
        <H2>Improvements</H2>
        
        
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Made `\\' follow the balancing rules for various integer types.</li>
          <li>Precompiled libraries now precompiles all classes reachable from 
          clusters defined in project settings only if root class is ANY, 
          otherwise it will only precompile classes reachable from the root 
          class. In 5.1 and prior version it was precompiling all classes 
          reachable from clusters.</li>
</ul>
        
        
        <h2>Bug fixes</h2>
        
        
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed issue in storable mechanism when retrieving expanded 
          objects.</li>
          <li>Fixed incorrect C code generation in final mode when creating an 
          <span class="eclass">ARRAY</span> of expanded type.</li>
          <li>Fixed incorrect C code generation in final mode when creating a 
          complex object which contains expanded objects that have expanded 
          objects.</li>
          <li>Fixed random crash issue in finalized applications due to incorrect memory management when 
          you have code similar to the following code:</li>
</ul>
        <pre>	<span class="efeature">f</span> (g: <span class="eclass">STRING</span>): <span class="eclass">ANY</span> <span class="ekeyword">is</span>
		<span class="ekeyword">do</span>
			Result := <span class="ekeyword">create</span> {<span class="eclass">STRING</span>}.<span class="efeature">make_from_string</span> (g)
		<span class="ekeyword">end</span></pre>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed issue with <span class="efeature">deep_equal</span> on <span class="eclass">ARRAY</span> of expanded types which was 
          returning <span class="ekeyword">False</span> where it should have returned <span class="ekeyword">True</span>.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue in melted code where computation such as <span class="eclass">INTEGER_X</span> // 
          <span class="eclass">INTEGER_Y</span> will either crash or give an incorrect computation where X 
          and Y represents integers that are either 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits long and X &lt; Y.</li>
          <li>Fixed incorrect C code generation of finalized code when your 
          project configuration includes a precompiled library and that you 
          cancel finalization process at degree -2, and then restart a 
          finalization.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue in IL code generation where having a class that 
          inherits from a non-Eiffel .NET class. And the class has the following 
          features:<br>
          <pre>	<span class="efeature">a</span>: <span class="eclass">ARRAY</span> [<span class="ekeyword">like</span> <span class="efeature">f</span>]
          <span class="efeature">f</span>: <span class="eclass">STRING</span>  <span class="ekeyword">is</span>
		<span class="ekeyword">do</span>
		<span class="ekeyword">end</span></pre>
          Then you could neither load nor execute the generated code.</li>
</ul>
