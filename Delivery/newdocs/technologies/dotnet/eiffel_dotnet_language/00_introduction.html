<h1>Introduction to Eiffel.NET</h1>

<p>This section focuses on defining the first version of Eiffel.NET. The
key requirement for Eiffel.NET is the exclusive use of the common language runtime
with a minimum Eiffel-specific runtime. The second requirement is to generate IL
code that is CLS compliant, meaning that other CLS compliant 
languages/compilers/tools will be able to reuse .NET components written in 
Eiffel.NET. The last requirement is to generate verifiable IL code.</p>
<p>Not all Eiffel functionalities are not present in .NET, for example .NET does
not support:</p>
<ul>
  <li>multiple inheritance</li>
  <li>genericity</li>
  <li>covariance</li>
  <li>agents</li>
</ul>
<p>We will see how to access .NET classes, which Eiffel mechanisms have been
implemented and which haven't.</p>
