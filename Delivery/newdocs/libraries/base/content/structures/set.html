		<H1>Sets</H1>
			<P>
				Sets are containers where successive occurrences of the same item
				are not distinguished: inserting the same item twice has the same observable
				effect as inserting it once.
			<H2>Deferred classes</H2>
				The most general class describing sets is
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/set.html">SET</A>. The
				usual operations of set theory such as union and intersection have
				been relegated to
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/subset.html">SUBSET</A>,
				an heir of <A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/set.html">SET</A>.
				This enables a class to inherit from
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/set.html">SET</A> without
				having to effect these operations if it satisfies the basic set property
				but has no convenient implementation of the subset operations.
			<H2>Sets without a notion of order</H2>
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/linked_set.html">LINKED_SET</A>
				provides a basic implementation of
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/set.html">SET</A> by
				linked lists.
			<H2>Sets of comparable elements and sorted sets</H2>
				The deferred class
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/comparable_set.html">COMPARABLE_SET</A>,
				declared as
			<P CLASS="code">
				<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">deferred class</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/comparable_set.html">COMPARABLE_SET</A>
				[G -> <A HREF="../../reference/kernel/comparable.html">COMPARABLE</A>]<BR>
				<BR><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">inherit</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/subset.html">SUBSET</A> [G]<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/comparable_struct.html">COMPARABLE_STRUCT</A> [G]<BR>
				...
			</P>
			<P>
				describes sets whose items may be compared by a total order relation. The class has the
				features
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/comparable_set.html#f_min">min</A> and
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/comparable_set.html#f_max">max</A>.<BR>
				Two implementations of
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/comparable_set.html">COMPARABLE_SET</A>
				are provided. One,
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/two_way_sorted_set.html">TWO_WAY_SORTED_SET</A>,
				uses sorted two-way lists. The other,
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/binary_search_tree_set.html">BINARY_SEARCH_TREE_SET</A>,
				uses binary search trees.<BR>
				If the items are partially rather than totally ordered, you may use the class
				<A HREF="../../reference/structures/set/part_sorted_set.html">PART_SORTED_SET</A>
				[G -&gt; <A HREF="../../reference/kernel/part_comparable.html">PART_COMPARABLE</A>],
				which uses a two-way sorted list implementation.
