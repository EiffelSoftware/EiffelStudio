		Translations of class names between a storing and a retrieving
		system. Values in this table are names of classes in the retrieving
		system, indexed by names of generating classes in the storing
		system (i.e. with no generic arguments). Values may have generic
		arguments (e.g. "MY_CLASS [DOUBLE]"), thus allowing a very simple
		conversion of a non-generic class into a generic class. The
		presence of entries in this table affects all retrieve operations
		for objects stored using `independent_store'.
