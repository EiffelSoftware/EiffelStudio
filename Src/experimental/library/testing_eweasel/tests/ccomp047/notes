Compiling a system with a call to an inline C external routine that
has formal arguments `a, ab, abc: INTEGER' and alias "$a + $ab +
$abc" produces C code that won't compile.  Perhaps there needs to be a
validity check that none of the formal argument names is a prefix of
another formal argument name for a "C inline" external routine.

Discovered in release 5.4.0515.
