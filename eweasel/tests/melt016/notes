After initial compilation where the system is frozen, an inherited
external BOOLEAN function is changed to an internal BOOLEAN function
and changes are melted.  System execution then ends with a run-time
panic which states "invalid assertion level".  The problem does not
occur if the changed routine is introduced directly in the class which
calls it, instead of appearing in an heir.

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
