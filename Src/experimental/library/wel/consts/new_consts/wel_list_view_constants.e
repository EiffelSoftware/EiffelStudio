			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_ICON

	Lvs_report: INTEGER = 1
			-- This style specifies report view. When using the LVS_REPORT

			-- Icons are automatically kept arranged in icon and small icon
			-- view.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_AUTOARRANGE

	Lvs_editlabels: INTEGER = 512
			-- Item text can be edited in place. The parent window must
			-- process the LVN_ENDLABELEDIT notification message.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_EDITLABELS

	Lvs_nocolumnheader: INTEGER = 16384
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_NOCOLUMNHEADER

	Lvs_nosortheader: INTEGER = 32768
			-- Column headers do not work like buttons. This style can be
			-- used if clicking a column header in report view does not
			-- carry out an action, such as sorting.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_NOSORTHEADER

	Lvs_nolabelwrap: INTEGER = 128
			-- Item text is displayed on a single line in icon view. By
			-- default, item text may wrap in icon view.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_NOLABELWRAP

	Lvs_noscroll: INTEGER = 8192
			-- Scrolling is disabled. All items must be within the client
			-- area. This style is not compatible with the LVS_LIST or
			-- LVS_REPORT styles.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_NOSCROLL

	Lvs_ownerdrawfixed: INTEGER = 1024
			-- The owner window can paint items in report view. The list
			-- view control sends a WM_DRAWITEM message to paint each item;
			-- it does not send separate messages for each subitem. The
			-- itemData member of the DRAWITEMSTRUCT structure contains the
			-- item data for the specified list view item.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_OWNERDRAWFIXED

	Lvs_shareimagelists: INTEGER = 64
			-- The image list will not be deleted when the control is
			-- destroyed. This style enables the use of the same image lists
			-- with multiple list view controls.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS

	Lvs_showselalways: INTEGER = 8
			-- The selection, if any, is always shown, even if the control
			-- does not have the focus.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_SHOWSELALWAYS

	Lvs_singlesel: INTEGER = 4
			-- Only one item at a time can be selected. By default, multiple
			-- items may be selected.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_SINGLESEL

	Lvs_sortascending: INTEGER = 16
			-- Item indices are sorted based on item text in ascending
			-- order.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_SORTASCENDING

	Lvs_sortdescending: INTEGER = 32
			-- Item indices are sorted based on item text in descending
			-- order.
			--
			-- Declared in Windows as LVS_SORTDESCENDING

feature -- Extended Style

	Lvs_ex_checkboxes: INTEGER = 4
			-- Version 4.70.
			-- Enables check boxes for items in a list view
			-- control. Effectively, when set to this style, the control
			-- will create and set a state image list using
			-- DrawFrameControl. Check boxes are visible and functional
			-- with all list view modes. You can obtain the state of the
			-- check box for a given item with ListView_GetCheckState. To
			-- set the check state, use ListView_SetCheckState.

	Lvs_ex_flatsb: INTEGER = 256
			-- Version 4.71.
			-- Enables flat scroll bars in the list view.
			-- If you need more control over the appearance of the list
			-- view's scroll bars, you should manipulate the list view's
			-- scroll bars directly using the Flat Scroll Bar APIs. If
			-- the system metrics change, you are responsible for adjusting
			-- the scrollbar metrics with FlatSB_SetScrollProp. See Flat
			-- Scroll Bars for further details.

	Lvs_ex_fullrowselect: INTEGER = 32
			-- Version 4.70.
			-- When an item is selected, the item and all its subitems are
			-- highlighted. This style is available only in conjunction
			-- with the LVS_REPORT style.

	Lvs_ex_gridlines: INTEGER = 1
			-- Version 4.70. Displays gridlines around items and subitems.
			-- This style is available only in conjunction with the LVS_REPORT
			-- style.

	Lvs_ex_headerdragdrop: INTEGER = 16
			-- Version 4.70. Enables drag-and-drop reordering of columns in
			-- a list view control. This style is only available to list
			-- view controls that use the LVS_REPORT style.

	Lvs_ex_infotip: INTEGER = 1024
			-- Version 4.71. When a list view control uses the
			-- LVS_EX_INFOTIP style, the LVN_GETINFOTIP notification message
			-- is sent to the parent window before displaying an item's
			-- tooltip.

	Lvs_ex_labeltip: INTEGER = 16384
			-- Version 5.80. If a partially hidden label in any list view
			-- mode lacks tooltip text, the list view control will unfold
			-- the label. If this style is not set, the list view control
			-- will unfold partly hidden labels only for the large icon mode.

	Lvs_ex_multiworkareas: INTEGER = 8192
			-- Version 4.71. If the list view control has the LVS_AUTOARRANGE
			-- style, the control will not autoarrange its icons until one or
			-- more work areas are defined (see LVM_SETWORKAREAS). To be
			-- effective, this style must be set before any work areas are
			-- defined and any items have been added to the control.

	Lvs_ex_oneclickactivate: INTEGER = 64
			-- Version 4.70. The list view control sends an LVN_ITEMACTIVATE
			-- notification message to the parent window when the user clicks
			-- an item. This style also enables hot tracking in the list view
			-- control. Hot tracking means that when the cursor moves over an
			-- item, it is highlighted but not selected. See the Remarks for a
			-- discussion of item activation.

	Lvs_ex_regional: INTEGER = 512
			-- Version 4.71. The list view will create a region that includes
			-- only the item icons and text and set its window region to that
			-- using SetWindowRgn. This will exclude any area that is not part
			-- of an item from the window region. This style is only available
			-- to list view controls that use the LVS_ICON style.

	Lvs_ex_subitemimages: INTEGER = 2
			-- Version 4.70. Allows images to be displayed for subitems.
			-- This style is available only in conjunction with the LVS_REPORT
			-- style.

	Lvs_ex_trackselect: INTEGER = 8
			-- Version 4.70. Enables hot-track selection in a list view
			-- control. Hot track selection means that an item is
			-- automatically selected when the cursor remains over the item
			-- for a certain period of time. The delay can be changed from
			-- the default system setting with a LVM_SETHOVERTIME message.
			-- This style applies to all styles of list view control. You
			-- can check whether or not hot-track selection is enabled by
			-- calling SystemParametersInfo.

	Lvs_ex_twoclickactivate: INTEGER = 128
			-- Version 4.70. The list view control sends an LVN_ITEMACTIVATE
			-- notification message to the parent window when the user
			-- double-clicks an item. This style also enables hot tracking
			-- in the list view control. Hot tracking means that when the
			-- cursor moves over an item, it is highlighted but not
			-- selected. See the Remarks for a discussion of item
			-- activation.

	Lvs_ex_underlinecold: INTEGER = 4096
			-- Version 4.71. Causes non-hot items that are activatable to be
			-- displayed with underlined text. This style requires that
			-- LVS_EX_TWOCLICKACTIVATE also be set. See the Remarks for a
			-- discussion of item activation.

	Lvs_ex_underlinehot: INTEGER = 2048
			-- Version 4.71. Causes hot items that are activatable to be
			-- displayed with underlined text. This style requires that
			-- LVS_EX_ONECLICKACTIVATE or LVS_EX_TWOCLICKACTIVATE also be
			-- set. See the Remarks for a discussion of item activation.

	Lvs_ex_doublebuffer: INTEGER = 0x10000
			-- Version 6.00. Uses double buffering for rendering items.
