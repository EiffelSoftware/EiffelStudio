ISE EiffelTime 5.0, 2001

Introduction
============
  The library EiffelTime is built on three notions of time. The absolute notion 
(for example, what time is it? 3:45 p.m.) is used for events. It may be useful 
also to deal with an interval between two events (the meeting is between
3:45 p.m.  and 6:00 p.m.). Finally EiffelTime has the notion of
duration, which is the length of an interval (the meeting will take
2:15). The notion of absolute is linked with duration by the use of an
origin.

Documentation
=============

A complete documentation can be found using the $EIFFEL4\docs\index.html file.

Installation
============

  Go to the directory $EIFFEL4\library\time\Clib and run make_msc.bat if your
C compiler is Microsoft or make_bcc if Borland. Under Unix, just launch 
finish_freezing.
