<h1>Multithreaded GC</h1>

<h2>Stop the world solution</h2>

<p>How to implement a portable stop the world solution?</p>
<p>In the Eiffel code, each Eiffel C generated routine is equipped with the 
following code:</p>
<pre>if (gc_collecting) {
	current_thread.status = thread_suspended
	gc_collecting_mutex.lock
	current_thread.status = thread_running
	gc_collecting_mutex.unlock
}</pre>
<p>For all routines from the thread library that might 
block we have:</p>
<pre>current_thread.status = blocked;
CALL TO BLOCKING STUFF
if (gc_collecting) {
	current_thread.status = thread_suspended
	gc_collecting_mutex.lock
	current_thread.status = thread_running
	gc_collecting_mutex.unlock
} else {
	current_thread.status = thread_running
}</pre>
<p>In the code which performs the GC we have the following:</p>
<pre>current_thread.status = thread_gc_starting

gc_collecting_mutex.lock
current_thread.status = thread_gc_started
gc_collecting = true

	// Wait until all threads are in a GC safe point.
Loop until all threads but current one are marked `suspended' or `starting_gc' or `blocked'.

Perform GC operation

gc_collecting = false

current_thread.status = thread_running
gc_collecting_mutex.unlock</pre>
<p>Of course the members are:</p>
<p>volatile int gc_collecting = 0;</p>
