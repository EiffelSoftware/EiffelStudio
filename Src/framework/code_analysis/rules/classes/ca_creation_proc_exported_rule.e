			RULE #13: Creation procedure is exported and may be called after object creation
	
			If the creation procedure is exported then
			it may still be called by clients after the object has been created.
			Ususally, this is not intended and ought to be changed. A client might,
			for example, by accident call 'x.make' instead of 'create x.make',
			causing the class invariant or postconditions of make not to hold anymore.
