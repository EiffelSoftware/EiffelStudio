		<h1>How to generate code and compile ?</h1>

		<p>
			The <a href = "../../guided_tour/40_settings_summary/index.html">final screen</a> of the .NET Wizard enables you to launch the code generation by clicking on `Finish'.<br>
			If you had previously selected the option `Compile the generated project', it will also compile the automatically generated Eiffel.NET sources.<br>
			If you want to check if the option is selected, just go back to the <a href = "../../guided_tour/10_project_name_and_location/index.html">second screen</a> of the wizard, which asks you if you want to compile or not.
