        <p>EiffelStudio relies on Melting Ice Technology, the proprietary compilation mechanism of ISE Eiffel,
        which offers three forms of compilation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>melting</i>   for making a few changes. The fastest of the mechanisms, typically taking a
            few seconds after small changes. Melting time is proportional to the size of the changed parts and
            affected classes, while the time needed to freeze or finalize is partly proportional to the size of the whole system. As long as you do not include
            new external C/C++ code, a C/C++ compiler is not required. However, execution speed is not optimal.
            The generated executable is debuggable.</li>
          <li><i>freezing</i> generates C code from the active system, and then compiles it into machine code; you must have a C/C++ compiler installed. You need to use
            this option if you add new agents or external C/C++ calls. Unless you add external code, you can re-freeze every couple of days. The rest of the time,
            you can melt your software to receive immediate feedback. The speed
            is still slower than when finalizing, but the generated executable
            is still debuggable.</li>
          <li><i>finalizing</i> delivers a production version (intermediate or final) of your software.
            It can be used to measure its performance in operational conditions.
            Finalization performs extensive time and space optimizations that enable Eiffel to match the efficiency of C/C++; it also creates a stand-alone C package that
            you can use for cross-platform development. Because of all the optimizations involved, finalizing takes the most
            time, and the generated executable is not debuggable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Melting and freezing generate an executable in the EIFGEN|W_code
        subdirectory of the project directory. The executable is composed of a
        standard executable file named after the system, and of a &lt;<i>system
        name</i>&gt;.melted file, which is called the Eiffel update file.
        Although it is recommended to finalize the system when running it from
        outside EiffelStudio (since the performance is better), it is possible
        to launch a melted/frozen executable. However, the Eiffel update file is
        necessary, the executable alone will not run.</p>
        <p>Basically, the Eiffel update file incorporates the changes that have
        been made to the system since it was last frozen. Therefore, it is very
        small when the system has just been frozen, and progressively becomes
        bigger each time the system is melted. On the contrary, the executable
        is only modified when the system is frozen, never when it is melted.</p>
        <p>The contents of the Eiffel update file are in a byte code
        representation which is dynamically interpreted at run-time.</p>
