How to make the WEL C library `wel.lib'?
----------------------------------------

If you have Borland C, run `make_bcc.bat'.
If you have Microsoft C, run `make_msc.bat'.

The makefiles assume that the C-compiler is in your $PATH environment
variable.

The environment variable ISE_EIFFEL needs to be set to where ISE Eiffel is
installed for these compilation. (This is usually `C:\Eiffel50').

To set the variable, type:

	SET ISE_EIFFEL=C:\Eiffel50
