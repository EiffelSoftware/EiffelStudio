An expanded class FOO has a function `weasel' whose return type is
`like Current'.  A routine declares a local entity of type FOO and
calls `weasel' on it, passing this result to another routine.  When
the system is executed, it dies with a segmentation fault, but only if
the system is melted.  Frozen code works fine.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
