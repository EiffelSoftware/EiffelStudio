Here is a set of two classes, along with some C code which impliments a 
basic wrapper around the GNU rx regular expression library.

This code was developed and tested on Linux for the SmallEiffel compiler.

To install, simply add location of the classes to the loadpath, and link 
with regex_glue.c or a compiled version.

To use:

	the class REGEX_COMPILER, which may be used expanded or inherited 
from, is used to create regular expressions.  The basic procedure uses
`compile' on the pattern of the expression, with succeeded true if the 
pattern could be compiled, and last_regex then containing the compiled regex
object.  There are also a number of flags which may be set to change this 
behaviour,  the action of which is as in the rx manual.

A compiled regular expression is used with the match procedure in class REGEX.
After a match 'succeeded' is true if the string matched.  The substrings of 
the match are available from item(i) and the number of substrings is the value
of count.  item(0) contains the string matched by the whole expreesion.


Todo:
	Mainly I havn't done much on the error reporting in the regular
expression compilation processes beyond reporting the presence of an error.
