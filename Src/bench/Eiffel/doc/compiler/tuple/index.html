<h1>Tuple implementation</h1>
<h2>Current state</h2>
<p>Let's describe how TUPLE is implemented between version 4.3 and 5.3. A tuple 
object stores its elements through an instance of SPECIAL[ANY]. It has the 
disadvantages to create dummy reference objects for expanded types. To 
circumvent this limitation, the runtime keeps track for all tuple types a string 
representing the basic nature of elements. For example TUPLE [INTEGER, STRING, 
INTEGER] has an associated &quot;iri&quot; string which tells that we have an integer, a 
reference and an integer.</p>

<h2>Improving internal data of TUPLE</h2>

<p>Instead of having to keep track of TUPLE types in a special area of the 
runtime, let's keep it with the TUPLE itself. That is to say, let's have:</p>
<pre>	// Possible types that a location can hold.
typedef union {
	EIF_BOOLEAN	barg;
	EIF_CHARACTER	carg;
	EIF_WIDE_CHAR	wcarg;
	EIF_DOUBLE	darg;
	EIF_INTEGER_8	i8arg;
	EIF_INTEGER_16	i16arg;
	EIF_INTEGER_32	i32arg;
	EIF_INTEGER_64	i64arg;
	EIF_POINTER	parg;
	EIF_REAL		farg;
	EIF_REFERENCE	rarg;
} EIF_ARG_UNION;


typedef struct {
	char		type;
	EIF_ARG_UNION	element;
} EIF_TYPED_ELEMENT;</pre>
<p>Now a TUPLE object is a non-resizable object which is basically a SPECIAL [EIF_ARG_UNION]. 
Which means that marking has to be done in a special way in the GC, that 
retrieve/store, equal/copy need to take this into account when extracting data 
from a TUPLE. To take this new type of object into account we have reused 
EO_CREAT and renamed it into EO_TUPLE to mark tuple objects.</p>

<p>To upgrade the runtime, most of the work consisted in doing a special case 
under EO_SPEC as tuple objects are allocated like special objects. So we added a 
check to EO_TUPLE. If check was satisfied, then we were doing a special case for 
tuple, otherwise we continue as we were doing it before.</p>
