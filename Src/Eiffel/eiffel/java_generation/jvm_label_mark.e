	description: "[
					  Representation of a JVM Label Mark.
					  A `JVM_LABEL_MARK' points to a `JVM_LABEL'.
					  Since the jump offset of (forward) jumps cannot be known at the time
					  the jump should be appended to the byte code of a method, we need to
					  store label marks, that point to a symbolic jump tarket.
		Once the position of the label is known (the label is closed) , we can go
					  back to the label mark and generate the actual jump offset.
