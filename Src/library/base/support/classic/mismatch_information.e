	instructions: "[
		This object will contain the original values of the attributes
		of a retrieved object for which a mismatched was detected at
		retrieval time. The value are indexed by the name of the attribute
		in the stored object. One extra entry is provided to contain the
		original name of the class in the storing system, indexed by the
		string 'class'. This allows `correct_mismatch' to determine the
		original name of its generating class in case class-name
		translation is in effect.
