The directory is called `Eiffel4' and
includes the ISE Eiffel delivery for the platforms
and product selection corresponding to your order.

The two files are the following:

	- `README.EIFFEL', whose contents are the present
	  text. The file `README' in the `Eiffel4' directory
	  has identical contents.

	- A file listing the full contents of the tape,
	  called `TAPE_CONTENTS.EIFFEL.nnn', where `nnn' is
	  some sequence of digits.

For installing ISE Eiffel, please refer to Appendices
B and C of ``ISE Eiffel: The Environment''.
