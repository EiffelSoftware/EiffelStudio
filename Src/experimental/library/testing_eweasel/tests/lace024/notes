An option clause in an Ace file specifies that one debug key is to be
enabled for classes A and B and a second debug key is to be enabled
only for class A.  When the system is executed, the second debug key
is monitored for both classes A and B.  Reversing the order of the
debug clauses corrects the problem.

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
