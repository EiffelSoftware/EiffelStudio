After initial compilation, a class which is not reachable from the
root is modified so that it has the same name as the root class.  The
Ace file does not specify what cluster the root class is in.  When the
system is recompiled, the compiler does not detect the VD29 violation.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
