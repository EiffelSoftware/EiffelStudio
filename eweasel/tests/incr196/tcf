test_name 	new-cluster-vscn-sneak
test_description A system with two classes is compiled.  Both classes are in the same cluster and the Ace file uses "all" to include all classes in the entire directory tree.  Then a new sub-directory is created and a class with the same name is added to it.  When the system is recompiled, the compiler does not detect the VSCN error.
