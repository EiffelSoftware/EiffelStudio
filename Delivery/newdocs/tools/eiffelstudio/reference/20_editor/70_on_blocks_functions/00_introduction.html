		<P>Editing the text of Eiffel classes sometimes implies highly repetitive tasks, such as commenting or indenting several lines at
		the same time.</P>
		<P>The new commands of the editor of EiffelStudio should allow the user to
        perform these tasks faster and more easily. In addition
		to text block <a href="./10_comment_and_uncomment.html">commenting</a> and <a href="./20_indent_and_unindent.html">indenting
		</a>, EiffelStudio editor makes it possible with one click to <a href="./30_embed_in_if_or_debug_structure.html">embed</A> several lines of code in
		&quot;if ... then ... end&quot; or &quot;debug ... end&quot;
		structures.
