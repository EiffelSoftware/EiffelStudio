The creation procedure of the root class repeatedly calls another
routine, which has a rescue clause.  This latter routine has a
qualified call of an exported feature in a class which has a class
invariant.  If assertion level `ensure' is specified for the class
with the invariant, system execution appears to continue indefinitely,
as it should.  If assertion level `invariant' is specified *and* the
class invariant is violated, system execution quickly ends with a
panic.  Also, once the class invariant is violated, it is never
checked again.

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
