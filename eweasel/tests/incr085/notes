A system is frozen and then executed, producing the correct output.
Then a class which was expanded is modified so that it is no longer
expanded and changes are melted.  When the resulting system is
executed, it dies with an exception trace while trying to create an
instance of the now non-expanded class.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
