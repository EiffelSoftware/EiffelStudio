After initial compilation where the system is melted, an expanded
class with no creation procedure adds a redefinition of
default_create.  The system is recompiled without error but the
creation procedure of the expanded class is called twice (it is only
called once if final classes are compiled from scratch).

Discovered in Release 5.4.0403.
