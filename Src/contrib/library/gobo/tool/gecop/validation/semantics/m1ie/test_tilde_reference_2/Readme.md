# Semantics M1IE

This [test](.) is exercising the semantics rule [`M1IE`](../Readme.md).

### Description

In this test, we have an inequality expression of the form `c /~ d` where `c` is attached to an object of type `STRING_8` and `d` is attached to an object of type `STRING_32`. The value of this expression is true because the objects don't have the same type.
