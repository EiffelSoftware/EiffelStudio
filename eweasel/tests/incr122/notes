After initial compilation, the order of two attributes (which are each
of an expanded type) is switched.  After recompilation, system
execution should initialize the expanded attributes in a different
order but it does not.  The initial compilation and recompilation can
each be either a melt or a freeze - the problem occurs regardless.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
