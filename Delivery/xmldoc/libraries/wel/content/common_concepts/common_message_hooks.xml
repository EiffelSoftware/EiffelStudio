		<paragraph>  Each WEL library component implements a set of routines for processing the most common messages that a component  receives. For example, looking at WEL_FRAME_WINDOW, you will see that  there are many features which begin `on_'. Each of these features enable the user to know when a specific event has    occured, and to perform the appropriate processing as a result of this event.    Most of the time, you will only be interested in a small subset of these, necessary to your program.    For example, below is the code for on_paint:
			<code_block>Missing</code_block>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>  An on_paint message corresponds to the Wm_paint message generated by Windows whenever it needs to re-paint a window, and if you look at the feature, you can see that the arguments are a WEL_PAINT_DC and a WEL_RECT.  which are relevent to this message. By redefining this feature (and others as required), your code will be able to respond appropriately to windows events.

		<paragraph>  For different messages received by a control, the arguments will differ (sometimes there are none), but those arguments will always be relevent to the message.  For example, on_menu_command from WEL_COMPOSITE_WINDOW  has an INTEGER as an argument, the value of which is a unique menu identifier.
