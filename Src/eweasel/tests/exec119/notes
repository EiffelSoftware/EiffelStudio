A class calls a routine which recurses a few times and then raises a
developer exception.  The exception is rescued and the rescue clause
calls another routine which calls the recursive routine and retries
the exception.  System execution should terminate normally, but ends
with the second developer exception.

Sent in by Manu for release 5.0.036.
