This is the status of the communication package as of June 30th 1992.

The following is done:
	- connection between ewb and ised
	- connection between app and ised
	- exchange of an HELLO packet from app to ewb via ised
	- detection from ised that the remote ewb is gone

The following used to work but doesn't any more (?):
	- exchange of a string between ewb and app

The following remains to be done:
	- finite state automaton in ised to drive I/O requests
	- 1/2 FSA in both app and ewb to correctly handle I/O requests
	- selecting hooks in ewb (mainly via X11)
	- XDR specification and implementation of control requests
	- implementation of debugging requests (dynamic melting, breakpoints)
	- security concerns for the daemon
	- error checking to avoid multiple connections on same socket
	- probably, process identification: root class name + timestamp, e.g.
	- full tests and debugging (plan at least a week)
	- cleaning before run-time integration

It doesn't make any difference for the communication process whether
the two processes are local or remote.

We also have to plan communications with a wrapper, so that we avoid forking
a workbench, but let the wrapper (small process) do it for us.
