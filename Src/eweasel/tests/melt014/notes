The creation procedure of a class assigns Void to the attribute to
which the creation procedure is being applied (by the root creation
procedure).  Executing the system results in a segmentation fault, but
only if the system is melted.  If non-Void value is assigned instead,
the result is incorrect system execution output.

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
