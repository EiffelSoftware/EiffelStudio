feature -- Access

			-- Return -1 if the time stamp was not available, if the
			-- file did not exist for example, or if the time stamp
			-- didn't fit into an INTEGER. (Use DT_DATE_TIME.make_from_epoch
			-- to convert this time stamp to a human readable format.)

	same_physical_file (other_name: STRING): BOOLEAN
			-- Are current file and file named `other_name'
			-- the same physical file? Return False if one
			-- or both files don't exist. (Return True if
			-- it was impossible to determine whether the
			-- files were physically the same files.)

feature -- Basic operations

	change_name (new_name: STRING)
			-- Rename current file as `new_name'.
			-- Do nothing if the file could not be renamed, if
			-- it did not exist or if `new_name' is physically
			-- the same file as current file. Overwrite `new_name'
			-- if it already existed. If renaming was successful,
			-- then `name' is set to `new_name'.
			-- (`new_name' should follow the pathname convention
			-- of the underlying platform. For pathname conversion
			-- use KI_FILE_SYSTEM.pathname_from_file_system.)

	copy_file (new_name: STRING)
			-- Copy current file to `new_name'.
			-- Do nothing if the file could not be copied, if it
			-- did not exist or if `new_name' is physically
			-- the same file as current file. Overwrite `new_name'
			-- if it already existed.
			-- (`new_name' should follow the pathname convention
			-- of the underlying platform. For pathname conversion
			-- use KI_FILE_SYSTEM.pathname_from_file_system.)

			is_closed: is_closed
		deferred

	concat (a_filename: STRING)
			-- Copy content of file `a_filename' to the end of current file.
			-- Do nothing if file `a_filename' does not exist. Create
			-- current file if it does not exist yet. If file `a_filename'
			-- is physically the same as current file, then a copy of
			-- the file is appended to itself. Do nothing if current
			-- file could not be open in append mode or if file `a_filename'
			-- could not be opened in read mode.
			-- (`a_filename' should follow the pathname convention
			-- of the underlying platform. For pathname conversion
			-- use KI_FILE_SYSTEM.pathname_from_file_system.)
