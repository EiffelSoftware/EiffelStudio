test_name 	pass-expanded-like-current
test_description An expanded class FOO has a function `weasel' whose return type is `like Current'.  A routine declares a local entity of type FOO and calls `weasel' on it, passing this result to another routine.  When the system is executed, it dies with a segmentation fault, but only if the system is melted.  Frozen code works fine.
