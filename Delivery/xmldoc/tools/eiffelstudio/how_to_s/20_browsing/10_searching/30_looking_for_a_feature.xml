			<size >1</size>Looking for a feature
		</heading>There are many ways to find a feature in a class. In particular : 
		<list ordered="false">
			<item >You can use the 
				<link >
					<url >../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/30_feature_tool/00_introduction.xml</url>
					<label >feature tool</label>
				</link> and search the tree by expanding feature clauses. This tool, however, displays only the features that are defined or redefined in the current class text. If you do not know if the feature is inherited or not, you may therefore not find what you are looking for with this method.
			</item>
			<item >You can also use the 
				<link >
					<url >../../../reference/80_formatters/10_class_formatters/00_introduction.xml</url>
					<label >class tab</label>
				</link> in the context tool. It will allow you to see all the
				<link >
					<url >../../../reference/80_formatters/10_class_formatters/50_attributes_format.xml</url>
					<label > attributes</label>
				</link> or 
				<link >
					<url >../../../reference/80_formatters/10_class_formatters/55_routines_format.xml</url>
					<label >routines</label>
				</link>, or all the 
				<link >
					<url >../../../reference/80_formatters/10_class_formatters/75_exported_format.xml</url>
					<label >public features</label>
				</link> for instance. If you do not know if the feature you seek is an attributes or a function and if it is public, this may not be the right method either.
			</item>
			<item >If you know the name or a part of the name of the feature you are looking for, the easier and faster way will probably be to use the 
				<link >
					<url >../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/10_address_bars/10_main_address_bar.xml</url>
					<label >address bar</label>
				</link>. If you type this name in the feature field of thebar (using "*" and "?" wildcards if you want to), the editor will be centered on the right class if necessary (i.e. if the feature is inherited) and scroll to the position of the text of the feature.
			</item>
