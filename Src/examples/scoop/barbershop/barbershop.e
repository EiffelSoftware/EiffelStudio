feature {NONE} -- Implementation

	number_of_customers: INTEGER is 30
	number_of_chairs: INTEGER is 8
	number_of_haircuts: INTEGER is 3 -- how many times each customer wants to get hair cut
	time_for_hair_cut: INTEGER is 1000

	barber: attached separate BARBER
	shop: attached separate SHOP

	customers: ARRAY [SEP_CUSTOMER]

	launch_customer (a_customer: attached separate CUSTOMER) is
			-- launch customer in a controlled manner
			do
