A class has agents which are calls to a routine that takes a numeric
type (DOUBLE, REAL, INTEGER_64, INTEGER, INTEGER_16, INTEGER_8) and
prints its argument.  If a lighter type is passed as the actual
argument (e.g., INTEGER_8 is passed to a routine expecting an INTEGER)
the arguments are passed incorrectly, resulting in wrong output, but
only if the routine is frozen.  Melted code works fine.

Discovered in Release 5.2.0928.
