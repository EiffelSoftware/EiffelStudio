A class has an external function which specifies a cast of the return
type (i.e., `external "C :EIF_INTEGER"').  After initial compilation
where the system is frozen, system execution works but produces the
wrong result.  Then some white space is added inside the Language_name
portion of the external, leaving its semantics unchanged and the
system is melted.  System execution then ends with a segmentation
fault.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
