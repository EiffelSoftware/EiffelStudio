	description: "[
	Objects that provide access to constants, possibly loaded from a files.
	Each constant is generated into two features: both a query and a storage
	feature. For example, for a STRING constant named `my_string', the following
	features are generated: my_string: STRING and my_string_cell: CELL [STRING].
	`my_string' simply returns the current item of `my_string_cell'. By seperating
	the constant access in this way, it is possible to change the constant's value
	by either redefining `my_string' in descendent classes or simply performing
	my_string_cell.put ("new_string") as required.
	If you are loading the constants from a file and you wish to reload a different set
	of constants for your interface (e.g. for multi-language support), you may perform
	this in the following way:
	
	set_file_name ("my_constants_file.text")
	reload_constants_from_file
	
	and then for each generated widget, call `set_all_attributes_using_constants' to reset
	the newly loaded constants into the attribute settings of each widget that relies on constants.
	
	Note that if you wish your constants file to be loaded from a specific location,
	you may redefine `initialize_constants' to handle the loading of the file from
	an alternative location.
	
	Note that if you have selected to load constants from a file, and the file cannot
	be loaded, you will get a precondition violation when attempting to access one
	of the constants that should have been loaded. Therefore, you must ensure that either the
	file is accessible or you do not specify to load from a file.
