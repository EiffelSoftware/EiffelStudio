test_name 	 rename-get-new-precursor
test_description A class calls a routine and the routine calls its precursor. After initial compilation, system execution works correctly.  Then a rename is removed, which causes the routine with the precursor call to have a different precursor.  Recompilation works but execution output is wrong.
