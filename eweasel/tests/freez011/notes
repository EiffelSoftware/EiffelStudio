A system sets a variable to the character constants `%/128/' and
`%/255/' and then checks to see if the variable is equal to the value
just assigned to it.  The system compiles fine when frozen, but thinks
the variable is not equal to the character just assigned to it for
characters `%/128/' and above.  Melted code works correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
