A class has a feature of type `HASH_TABLE [STRING, NONE]'.  After the
compiler correctly detects a VUAR error, NONE is changed to STRING,
thereby making the class correct.  When compilation is resumed, the
compiler dies with a segmentation fault during degree -1 on
HASH_TABLE.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
