            <tr>
              <td>The example classes discussed in this section appear in the
                subdirectory <i>datagram </i>of the example directory</td>

        <p>Using datagram sockets implies a few differences from the preceding
        schemes. You create a <a href="../reference/network/socket/network_datagram_socket_chart.html">NETWORK_DATAGRAM_SOCKET</a>
        or a <a href="../reference/local/socket/unix_datagram_socket_chart.html">UNIX_DATAGRAM_SOCKET</a>
        as before. You do not need to call <i>listen</i>, <i>accept</i> or <i>connect</i>.
        Once you have created your sockets using the <i>make_client </i>or <i>make_server</i>
        creation procedure, you can use the <i>send </i>and <i>received </i>routines,
        specifying the socket to which you want to send, or from which you want
        to receive.</p>
        <p>The command <i>send </i>takes an argument of type <a href="../reference/abstract/socket/datagram_packet_chart.html">DATAGRAM_PACKET</a>,
        and the query <i>received </i>returns a result of this type. <a href="../reference/abstract/socket/datagram_packet_chart.html">DATAGRAM_PACKET</a>
        is an heir of class <a href="../reference/abstract/socket/packet_chart.html">PACKET</a>,
        itself an heir of <a href="../../base/reference/kernel/array_chart.html">ARRAY</a><i>
        </i>[<a href="../../base/reference/kernel/character_chart.html">CHARACTER</a>].
        Class <a href="../reference/abstract/socket/datagram_packet_chart.html">DATAGRAM_PACKET</a>
        makes it possible, through the query <i>number</i> and the associated
        command <i>set_number</i>, to associate a packet number with each
        packet. This compensates for lack of guaranteed sequencing of datagram
        sockets: the sender can number packets through <i>set_number</i>, and
        the receiver can check that all packets have been received through <i>number</i>,
        asking the sender to re-emit missing objects.</p>
        <p>The text of this example is similar to what appears below (in a more
        general setting involving event-driven computation) for the next
        example.</p>
