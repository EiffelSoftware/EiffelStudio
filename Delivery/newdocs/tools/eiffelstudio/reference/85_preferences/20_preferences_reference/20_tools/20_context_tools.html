<h1>
Context tools</h1>
This sub-categories gathers the preferences related to context tools.
<p>There are four of them :
<table>
<tr>
<td>Label in the preferences window</td>

<td>Complete description</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Share addresses between the editor and the context tool?</td>

<td>This boolean preference set whether, by default, the editor and the
context tools display information about the same element (Class, Feature
or Cluster). The default value is True.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Show ALL classes in the diagram?</td>

<td>You can choose not to display some classes in the Diagram Tool. If
you set this property to False, you will be given the opportunity to define
the list of such classes (see below). The default value is False.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Names of classes that should not appear in generated diagrams.</td>

<td>This is the list of classes that will be ignored in the Diagram tool
if the previous preferences is set to False. By default, this list includes
: INTEGER, BOOLEAN, STRING, CHARACTER, REAL and DOUBLE.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Order used to sort feature clauses in formatted texts.</td>

<td>This sets the order of appearance of feature clauses in class text
when it is displayed in all forms but the basic text one (i.e. Clickable,
Flat, Contract forms or Interface).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Show all callers in `callers' form.</td>

<td>When the Feature Tool is centered on a feature, you can see its callers
by requesting the `callers' form. If this property is set to True, this
of callers will include calls to descendant versions of the feature. Otherwise,
it will not. The default value is True.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Show syntactical suppliers (as opposed to actual suppliers) in the
`suppliers' form.</td>

<td>There are two types of suppliers for a given class. On one hand, there
are the syntactical suppliers, i.e. the ones the name of which appear in
the class text. On the other hand, there are the actual suppliers, i.e.
the ones features of which are used in the class. This preference allows
you to choose what type you want to be displayed when you select the `suppliers'
form in the class tool. If it is True, syntactical suppliers will be shown.
The default value is False.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Indexing items that need not be included in formatted texts.</td>

<td>This is a list of items in the indexing clause that will be hidden
in Clickable, Flat, Contract forms and the Interface of classes. By default,
it includes "revision", "date" and "status".</td>
