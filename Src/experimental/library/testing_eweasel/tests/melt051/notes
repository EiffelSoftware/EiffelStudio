A class creates an instance of INTERNAL and uses it to print the field
count of the current object.  The system compiles fine when frozen and
correctly prints 0 when executed.  Then an attribute is added to the
class and changes are melted.  System execution then incorrectly still
prints 0, instead of 1.

Reported by Manu on Release 5.1.
