test_name 	melted-void-expanded-arg
test_description After initial compilation and freezing, the type of a formal argument to routine is changed from `TEST1' to `expanded TEST1' and changes are melted.  Since the actual argument is Void, a "void assigned to expanded" exception should occur when the system is executed. Instead, execution terminates with "illegal instruction" and no exception trace.
