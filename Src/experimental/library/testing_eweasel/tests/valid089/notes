A class TEST calls (on an entity of type TEST1) a feature which should
be exported to it.  The compiler incorrectly rejects the class as
violating VUEX(2).  If an export restriction is changed from `{TEST1}'
to `{NONE}', which if anything ought to make fewer features exported
to TEST, the compiler correctly accepts the classes.

Discovered in release 3.2.3b.
