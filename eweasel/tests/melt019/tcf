test_name 	postcondition-veen-then-restore
test_description After initial compilation where the system is frozen, an entity name in a postcondition is changed to the name of a nonexistent entity. When the compiler reports the VEEN error, the entity name is changed back to its original value and compilation completes.  But execution of the resulting system ends with a run-time panic which states "invalid assertion level".
