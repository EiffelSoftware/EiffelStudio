test_name 	finalize-call-undef-external
test_description A system has a class with an external routine and another class which inherits the first class and undefines the external routine.  There is also a call to the undefined version of the external routine (which cannot work at run-time, of course).  When the system is finalized, the generated C code won't compile.
