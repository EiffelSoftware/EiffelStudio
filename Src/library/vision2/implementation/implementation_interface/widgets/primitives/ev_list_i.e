feature -- Access

	get_item (index: INTEGER): EV_LIST_ITEM is
			-- Give the item of the list at the zero-base
			-- `index'.
		require
			exists: not destroyed
			item_exists: index <= count
		deferred

			-- Item which is currently selected, for a multiple
			-- selection, it gives the item which has the focus.
		require
			exists: not destroyed
			item_selected: selected
		deferred
		end

	selected_items: LINKED_LIST [EV_LIST_ITEM] is
			-- List of all the selected items. For a single
			-- selection list, it gives a list with only one
			-- element which is `selected_item'. Therefore, one
			-- should use `selected_item' rather than 
			-- `selected_items' for a single selection list

			exists: not destroyed

		deferred
		end

feature -- Status report

	count: INTEGER is
			-- Number of lines

			-- True if the user can choose several items
			-- False otherwise

feature -- Status setting

	set_multiple_selection is
			-- Allow the user to do a multiple selection simply
			-- by clicking on several choices.

	set_single_selection is
			-- Allow the user to do only one selection. It is the
			-- default status of the list

			-- selected.

	add_double_click_selection_command (a_command: EV_COMMAND; arguments: EV_ARGUMENTS) is
			-- Make `command' executed when an item is
			-- selected.
