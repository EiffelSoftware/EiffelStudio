Transition labels
-----------------

A transition label is a value attached to a command. The 
definition of a command includes the definition of a set 
of possible transition values, or labels. When a session 
of the system executes an instance of the command, it will 
set the value of the transition to one of the possible 
transition labels. For example a file opening command might 
have the transition labels `opened', `failed' and `canceled', 
corresponding to three possible outcomes of the command. Any 
particular execution of the command will set the transition 
value to one of these labels. A transition will bring the 
system in another state.

To produce a real transition bring up the application editor. 
Click on the source state name in the `State'-field, click on the 
transition label in the `Transition'-field; and drag-and-drop it 
to the target state of the desired transition.

Apart from the transitions that you define yourself, three special
transition types are always available:

 - `self', the default, leaves the session in the current state
 - `return', brings the session back to the previous state, in 
   a last-in, first-out way
 - `exit', terminates the application

To apply these special types to any transition, drag-and-drop the
transition in one of the corresponding holes at the top of the
application editor.
