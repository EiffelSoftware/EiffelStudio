		<paragraph>This Invitation assumes that you have some experience of software development, but that's all.  Previous exposure to object technology is not required.  If you've had it, it will help; but if it has all been to notations like UML or programming languages like C++ and Java, you should not let it guide your study of this Invitation. Although Eiffel shares a number of properties with these other approaches, it takes a fresh path to object technology, based on a small number of simple, far-reaching concepts.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Once you are familiar with the basic ideas you may want to try them with EiffelStudio, which provides a direct implementation of the Eiffel concepts, available in a completely portable way across Windows, Linux, many versions of Unix and VMS.  </paragraph>
