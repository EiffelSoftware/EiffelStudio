test_name 	 external-make-precondition-true
test_description A class calls an external routine with a precondition that is false. When the system is executed, the precondition is violated and an exception is raised, which is correct.  Then the precondition is changed so that it is true and changes are melted.  System execution still violates the precondition, but should not.
