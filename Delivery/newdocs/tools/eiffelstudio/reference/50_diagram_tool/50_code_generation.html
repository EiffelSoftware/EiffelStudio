		<P>All actions taken in the diagram tool that modify a part of the system are immediately reflected in the Eiffel system. Following is a summary of these actions.
		<UL>
			<LI>When you create a new class, this is the generated empty class:<BR>

<CODE><PRE>indexing
	description: &quot;Objects that ...&quot;
	author: &quot;&quot;
	date: &quot;$Date$&quot;
	revision: &quot;$Revision$&quot;

class
	CLASS_NAME

end -- class CLASS_NAME</PRE></CODE>

			<LI>When you delete a class, the class file is removed from the disk.

			<LI>When you add a parent to a class, the parent is inserted in the existing inheritance clause, <I>without</I> any additional (<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">undefine</SPAN>/<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">select</SPAN>/etc.) clauses to solve possible conflicts.<BR>

<CODE><PRE>indexing
	description: &quot;Objects that ...&quot;
	author: &quot;&quot;
	date: &quot;$Date$&quot;
	revision: &quot;$Revision$&quot;

class
	CLASS_NAME

inherit
	NEW_PARENT

end -- class CLASS_NAME</PRE></CODE>

			<LI>When removing an inheritance link, the entire parent clause is removed, i.e. including any <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">redefine</SPAN>/<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">undefine</SPAN>/etc. until the matching <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>.

			<LI>When creating a client link, a function or attribute is generated by the feature wizard. When creating a function, this code is generated:<BR>

<CODE><PRE>indexing
	description: &quot;Objects that ...&quot;
	author: &quot;&quot;
	date: &quot;$Date$&quot;
	revision: &quot;$Revision$&quot;

class
	CLASS_NAME

feature -- Access

	f: TYPE is
			-- Client from CLASS_NAME to TYPE.
		do
		end

end -- class CLASS_NAME</PRE></CODE>

			<LI>If you choose to create an attribute for the client link, and optionally specify to generate a set-procedure and an invariant, the following code will be pasted into the class text:<BR>

<CODE><PRE>indexing
	description: &quot;Objects that ...&quot;
	author: &quot;&quot;
	date: &quot;$Date$&quot;
	revision: &quot;$Revision$&quot;

class
	CLASS_NAME

feature -- Access

	f: TYPE
			-- Client from CLASS_NAME to TYPE.

feature -- Element change

	set_f (a_f: TYPE) is
			-- Assign `a_f' to `f'.
		require
			a_f_not_void: a_f /= Void
		do
			f := a_f
		ensure
			f_assigned: f = a_f
		end

invariant
	f_not_void: f /= Void

end -- class CLASS_NAME</PRE></CODE>

			<LI>When removing a client link, only the matching function or attribute is removed. Any additionally generated set-feature or invariant is not removed.

			<LI>When removing a cluster, the associated directory is not erased,
              but the reference to the cluster is removed from the Ace file. At this
              time, it is not possible to create a cluster using the diagram tool, only
              to remove one.
