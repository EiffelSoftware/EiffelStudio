test_name 	 manifest-array-waste-locals
test_description A class has a routine which has 1000 instructions, each of which is `a := << 1 >>'.  The system compiles fine when frozen and the C code compiles (as long as one doesn't use the -O option).  When the system is executed, it dies with an "out of locals" run-time panic.
