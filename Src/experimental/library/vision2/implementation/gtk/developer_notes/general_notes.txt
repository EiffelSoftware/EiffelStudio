This is the Eiffel Vision II programmers notes section


ev_bugs -- insert text relating to bugs found (following given structure)
to_be_implemented -- insert text concerning routines that require implementation
Re_implement -- insert text concerning routines that need re-doing/optimising.

Is it worth setting up an internal web-page for ISE developers that deals with this?

This file is also for entering ideas/observations about the new Vision II library.
