A system creates an instance of a class and prints the value of its
only feature, which is a function returning INTEGER.  After initial
compilation where the system is frozen, the constant is changed to an
INTEGER attribute and changes are melted.  System execution still
produces the correct result.  Then the feature is changed to an
INTEGER constant and changes are melted.  System execution then
produces the wrong result (the value returned by the original
function).

Discovered in release 5.4.0610.
