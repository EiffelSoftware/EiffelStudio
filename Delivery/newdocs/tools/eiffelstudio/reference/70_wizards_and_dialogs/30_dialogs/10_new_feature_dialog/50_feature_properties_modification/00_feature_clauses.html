<h1>
Feature clauses</h1>
The feature you create will be inserted in the feature clause you specified.
If the feature clause was not already in your class, or not in the right
place, EiffelStudio adds the feature clause to the class text based on
the feature clause order specified in the <a href="../../../../85_preferences/20_preferences_reference/20_tools/20_context_tools.html">preferences</a>.
By default, this is the order used by the ISE libraries, such as EiffelBase.
<h2>
Export status</h2>
The export status is the class the feature is accessible for. Usually,
this is&nbsp;<span CLASS="eclass">ANY</span> for public features, or&nbsp;<span CLASS="eclass">NONE</span>
for implementation features, but you can specify any class here.

<p CLASS="note"><b>Note</b>: in the class text, you can export a feature
to more than one class but (for simplicity) not with this dialog.
<h2>
Feature clause names</h2>
For feature clause names it is recommended that you pick one from the standard
ones, but it is also possible to create a new one. If you have introduced
a special feature clause name in your project, add it to the feature clause
order list in the <a href="../../../../85_preferences/20_preferences_reference/20_tools/20_context_tools.html">preferences</a>
and it will also appear in this dialog.

<h2>
Generated code</h2>
The code that is inserted in your class as a result of the selections made
for the feature clause, is of the form:
<br><span CLASS="efeature"><tt>feature</span><span CLASS="esymbol">{</span><span CLASS="eclass">EXPORT</span><span CLASS="esymbol">}</span><span CLASS="ecomment">--
Clause name</tt></span>
<br>except if you specified&nbsp;<span CLASS="eclass">ANY</span> as export
status, which is similar to having no export status.
<br><span CLASS="efeature"><tt>feature</span><span CLASS="ecomment">--
Clause name</tt></span>
<br>For example, if you specified a the "Initialization" feature clause
name, and specified&nbsp;<span CLASS="eclass">NONE</span> as export status,
you get:
<br><span CLASS="efeature"><tt>feature</span><span CLASS="esymbol">{</span><span CLASS="eclass">NONE</span><span CLASS="esymbol">}</span><span CLASS="ecomment">--
Initialization</tt></span>
</body>
