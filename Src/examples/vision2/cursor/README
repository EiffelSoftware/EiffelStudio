This example shows how to change the cursor in an application and how to pick
and drop (PND) a list item using a dedicated cursor which changes according to
the area the pointer is over. 

The text field is the only widget which accepts to receive something (a string)
by the PND mechanim. When the pointer comes over that text field the cursor
appears with a shape corresponding to the selected list item. A right click will
write the cursor name in the field.
