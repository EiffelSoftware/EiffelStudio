		<p>
			The Eiffel Assembly Cache is a repository where the compiler saves the required information to be able to <b>associate Eiffel names with .NET names</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It also <b>keeps tracks of the changes</b> you make when editing types via the <a href = "./type_view.html">type view</a>:
			the Eiffel Assembly Cache is updated (i.e. existing names replaced by the new ones) once ISE Assembly Manager has checked  the changes consistency.<br>
			ISE Assembly Manager is notified whenever the Eiffel Assembly Cache is modified, so that it always <b>displays the relevant names</b>.
		</p>
		<p class = "note">
			<b>Note</b> that the Eiffel Assembly Cache is <b>self-sufficient</b>: When you launch the Eiffel code generation from ISE Assembly Manager (via the <a href = "./eiffel_generation_dialog.html">Eiffel generation dialog</a>), the generator finds all needed information in the Eiffel Assembly Cache. There is no need to explore the assembly metadata anymore, which results in noteworthy gain of time.
		</p>

		<br>
		<p>
			The Eiffel Assembly Cache is located in &quot;$ISE_EIFFEL&quot;\dotnet\assemblies&quot;, where $ISE_EIFFEL is the path to your Eiffel delivery.
			If you explore it, you will see that information is saved in separate folders, each folder corresponding to one imported assembly.
