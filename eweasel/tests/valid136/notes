A class has a call to a static feature `feature {FOO [BIT
weasel]}.value' where FOO is an unconstrained generic class, but
`weasel' is an unknown identifier.  The compiler accepts the class but
should not.  Executing melting system prints "Error: could not read
Eiffel update file".

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
