?S:d_csh:
?S:	This variable conditionally defines the CSH symbol, which
?S:	indicates to the C program that the C-shell exists.
?S:.
?S:full_csh:
?S:	This variable contains the full pathname to 'csh', whether or
?S:	not the user has specified 'portability'.  This is only used
?S:	in the compiled C program, and we assume that all systems which
?S:	can share this executable will have the same full pathname to
?S:	'csh.'
?S:.
?X:	Yes, I know about the C symbol PORTABLE, but I think csh
?X:	is unlikely to move, and I'm too lazy to add all the
?X:	#ifdef PORTABLE sections to the perl source.
?X:	
?C:CSH:
?C:	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the C-shell exists.
?C:	If defined, contains the full pathname of csh.
