test_name 	 vtcg-instead-of-vtug2
test_description A generic class CHILD has an inheritance clause `TEST1 [CHILD]', which should elicit a VTUG(2) error.  Instead, the compiler reports a VTCG error in the generic constraint of a different class.  But in order to discover the VTCG violation, the compiler should have had to analyse CHILD enough to detect the VTUG error.
