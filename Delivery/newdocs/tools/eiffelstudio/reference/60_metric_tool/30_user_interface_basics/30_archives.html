        in the metric tool is provided to handle archives. This operation is
        really specific. It allows comparison between system scopes.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it is actually easy to compare smaller scopes (such as
        features, classes and clusters) one to another among the same project.
        But this is different for systems since one project contains one and
        only one system. That is why archives have been created, to store
        measures for a given system when it is loaded and retrieve them later on
        when another system is being loaded.</p>
        <p>The metric tool allows two kinds of facilities concerning archives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creation and update for the loaded system</li>
          <li>Comparison to another system whose measures have been archived</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/Metrics_png/archive.png"></p>
        <p align="left">Which allows archive creation update and comparison. for
        more details see section: <a href="/tools/eiffelstudio/how_to_s/70_analyzing_a_project/30_handling_archives/00_introduction.html">handling
        archives</a>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">The metric tool creates automatically a sub folder named
        &quot;Metrics&quot; in the current location of the loaded project. It is
        advised, but not compulsory, to save created archives in that folder,
        since it has been provided for metric needs.</p>
