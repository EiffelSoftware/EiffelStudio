<h1>Unix/Linux Users:</h1>
<p>ISE EiffelBench supports `gcc' on most of platforms and the native `cc'
compiler if it is an ANSI C compiler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="microsoft">Microsoft Visual C++ Users:</a></h1>
<p>ISE EiffelBench supports only version 5.0 or higher of the Microsoft Visual C++
environment. You can still use older version of the Microsoft C++ environment (version 4.1 and 4.2), but this won't be supported by ISE.<br>
<br>
If you are still planning to use version 4.2 or 4.1 or Microsoft Developer Studio, you need to copy the file `config.eif' from the
`$EIFFEL\Docs' directory to $EIFFEL4\bench\spec\windows\config\msc where $EIFFEL4 represents the installation directory of ISE Eiffel.</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="borland">Borland C++ Users:</a></h1>

<p>
ISE EiffelBench only supports version 4.52 and higher of Borland C++. In order to make the Borland tools work with the ISE EiffelBench environment,
make sure that you properly installed Borland C++ and that the C compiler tools are available from the command line
(check with the installation notes of Borland C++ on how to do so).
<p>
In addition you need to define the environment variable EIF_BORLAND to denote the LIB subdirectory of your Borland installation, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If you installed Borland C++ at this location: D:\BC5<br>
    Then  you should set EIF_BORLAND to D:\BC5\LIB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

<h1>Borland C++ Builder Users:</h1>
<p>In the delivery of ISE EiffelBench you will find all the needed files to support Borland C++ Builder 4.0 or higher.
C++ Builder is, however, not a supported environment because of what appears to be a bug in the Borland C++ Builder delivery.
We are sorry about this issue and awaiting an answer from Borland/Inprise as to how long it will take to fix the problem.
<p>In the meantime, we recommend that you either upgrade to <a href="#microsoft"> Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0</a> or downgrade to
<a href="#borland"> Borland C++ 4.52 or higher</a>.
<p>&nbsp;
<h1>Cygwin Users:</h1>
<p>In the delivery of ISE EiffelBench you will find all the needed files to
support the GNU gcc port for Windows. However, ISE does not support it because
of what appears to be a bug in the cygwin delivery with the bin utils. We are
sorry about this issue and awaiting for a fix from the GNU community.
<p>In the meantime, we recommend that you choose <a href="#microsoft"> Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0</a> or
<a href="#borland">Borland C++ 4.52 or higher</a>.
