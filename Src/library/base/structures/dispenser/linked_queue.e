feature -- Initialization

	make is
			-- Create linked queue.
		do
			after := True
		end

feature -- Access

	item: G is
			-- Oldest item
		do
			Result := active.item
		ensure then
			last_element_if_not_empty: 
				not is_empty implies (active = last_element)
		end

feature -- Element change

			-- Add `v' as newest item.
		do
			put_front (v)

			after := True
		ensure then
			single_item_constraint: (old is_empty) implies (item = v)

feature -- Conversion

feature -- Duplication

	duplicate (n: INTEGER): like Current is
			-- New queue containing the `n' oldest items in current queue.
			-- If `n' is greater than `count', identical to current queue.

			-- Remove one occurrence of `v'.
			-- Not available.
		do
			-- Do nothing

			-- Remove all occurrences of `v'.
			-- Not available
