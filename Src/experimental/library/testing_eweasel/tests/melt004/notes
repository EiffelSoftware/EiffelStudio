Passing an actual argument which is a reference type to a routine
whose corresponding formal argument is the expanded version of that
reference type compiles fine, but when the resulting system is
executed an exception trace occurs.  The exception trace only occurs
when the classes are melted, not when they are frozen.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
