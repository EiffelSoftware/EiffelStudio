A class has a routine with a postcondition which references `old arg'
where `arg' (the routine's argument) is of an expanded type.  When
postconditions are monitored and the system is melted, evaluation of
the postcondition appears to incorrectly cause some creations of
objects of the expanded type.  Frozen code works as expected, with no
hidden object creations.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
