        <h3>What is EiffelNet?</h3>
        <p>The client-server model of computing is quickly gaining ground as a
        way of optimizing network resources and of building sophisticated and
        flexible transactional applications.</p>
        <p>The object-oriented method of software development, as embodied in
        Eiffel, potentially provides ideal support for developing client-server
        applications. The EiffelNet library described in this report makes this
        potential a reality by addressing one the crucial needs of client-server
        development: how to exchange objects between software systems. Systems
        using EiffelNet can exchange object structures with other systems
        running on the same machine or on different machines; in the case of
        different machines, the hardware architectures need not be the same.
        Objects are transmitted using sockets.</p>
        <p>Writing client-server applications, especially their communication
        aspects, is an arduous task; developers must master many tricky details
        of socket programming and other low-level mechanisms. EiffelNet hides
        this complexity by providing ready-made classes addressing the most
        common cases, so that developers only have to describe what is specific
        to their application, letting EiffelNet handle the whole process of
        communication and synchronization between clients and servers. This part
        of EiffelNet is known as the <b>predefined level</b> and for many uses
        this is the only one that you will need to learn about. For developments
        requiring a finer degree of control, all the major mechanisms of socket
        programming are still accessible in a convenient form through more
        specialized classes.</p>
        <p>In offering these varying levels of abstraction and control,
        EiffelNet follows the principles set by other libraries of the ISE
        Eiffel 3 environment (see for example the discussion of EiffelLex in
        reference [2]). Some users require a mechanism that will be very easy to
        learn and will hide all the details in common cases; other users (or the
        same at later stages of their work) need to access the whole array of
        facilities available at the level of the underlying hardware or
        software. The various components of the library should address all these
        needs.</p>
        <p>This manual describes how to use EiffelNet at its various levels of
        abstraction.</p>
        <h3>Background and prerequisites</h3>
        <p>EiffelNet is a component of the ISE Eiffel 3 development environment.
        Please contact your ISE Eiffel distributor or ISE to find out how to
        acquire EiffelNet if it is not already part of your delivery.</p>
        <p>This manual assumes the following prerequisites:
        <ul>
          <li>Familiarity with the basic Eiffel concepts: classes, inheritance,
            features, assertions, exception handling (see reference [1]).
          <li>Experience of writing software with Eiffel.
          <li>Basic knowledge of the EiffelBase libraries, as described in
            reference [2].</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Familiarity with the basic concepts of client-server computing will
        also be helpful (see for example reference [3]; if you are new to this
        area, however, you will still be able to use EiffelNet, as this manual
        defines all the needed concepts.</p>
