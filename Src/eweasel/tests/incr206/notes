After initial compilation, a class TEST2 which is used as an actual
generic parameter (where the corresponding formal generic parameter
has creation procedures specified and is used to declare attributes)
is changed so that it is an expanded class.  One of the creation
procedure names is also removed from the generic constraint.  When the
system is recompiled, system execution dies with a segmentation fault.

Discovered in release 5.4.0515.
