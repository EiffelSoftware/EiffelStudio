Gobo Eiffel Parse Library

This library provides parsing functionalities such as syntactical analyzers
(also known as parsers). This library is mainly used by Gobo Eiffel Yacc
(geyacc). To get information about Geyacc, have a look at "$GOBO/doc/geyacc"
and "$GOBO/src/geyacc/Redame.txt". Examples for both Geyacc and this library
can be found in "$GOBO/example/parse".
