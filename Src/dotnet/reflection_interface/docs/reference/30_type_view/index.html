		<h1>The Type View</h1>

        <p>
			The type view allows to edit the feature names and argument names of
        Eiffel <a href="../00_definitions/external_class.html">external classes</a>.
		</p>

        <p>At the top of the window, the name, version, culture and public key of the assembly the edited type belongs to is repeated.
        In the panel below, you will notice that some words appear italicized with a colored background. These are the
        words which can be edited. They include the name of every immediate feature and
        their arguments names (if any).
		</p>

		<p class = "note">
            <b>Note</b>: Only <b>immediate features</b> (i.e. features that are
        not inherited) and their arguments names are editable. To rename a
        feature which is inherited (or an argument whose related feature is inherited),
        open the <a href = "index.html">Type View</a>
        corresponding to the class where the feature is first declared.

		<h2>Facilities provided by the type view:</h2>

		<a name = rename_feature></a>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Renaming a class feature</b></li>
            <p>You may edit any feature name which appears italicized. Simply
            click on the name you wish to modify.
				</p>

			<li><b>Renaming a feature argument</b></li>
			<p>You can also rename the arguments of features which appear
            italicized. Simply click on the argument you wish to modify.</p>
		</ul>
        <p class="note"><b>
			Note:</b> Modifications are validated after you click on <i>OK</i>.
        Clicking on <i>Cancel</i> will revert all the changes.
		</p>
        <p>
            The Assembly Manager first checks that your <b>changes are consistent</b> before saving them. In case problems are detected, the
            list of errors appears at the bottom of the <a href = "index.html">Type
            View</a>.	When you click on an error message, the focus is given to the corresponding
            item (feature name or feature argument), inviting you to modify it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<center>
				<img src = "../../images/errors_type_view.png" no border>
			</center>
		</p>
        <p>Once all the changes have been validated, the Assembly Manager updates the
        corresponding Eiffel <a href="../00_definitions/external_class.html">external
        class.</a> Since it may take a few minutes, a message box appears during the Eiffel code generation:

			</center>
