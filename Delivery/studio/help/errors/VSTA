    Consider a  static access to  `f' a C external routine
    or a .NET static  external of a class `C'. The call is
    valid  if and  only if it  satisfies the following two
    conditions:

        1 `C' is a valid Class_type with no formals
		  and no anchors

        2 `f' is a frozen external routine without
		   assertions, a .NET static external or a
		   constant.
