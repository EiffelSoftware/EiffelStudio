test_name 	 skip-deferred-feat-assertions
test_description A class inherits a deferred feature from one class and an effective feature of the same name from another class.  Both features have a precondition and a postcondition.  The flatshort form of the heir class looks as expected, with all alternative preconditions present. But when the system is executed, the precondition and postcondition of the deferred precursor feature are not monitored.
