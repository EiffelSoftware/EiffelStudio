test_name 	 procedure-in-tuple
test_description Putting a procedure call (rather than a function call) as an element in a tuple causes the compiler to die in degree -1 if system is being frozen.  Melting is successful, but executing the resulting system gives an "operational stack botched" error.  Seems like there is a missing validity constraint.
