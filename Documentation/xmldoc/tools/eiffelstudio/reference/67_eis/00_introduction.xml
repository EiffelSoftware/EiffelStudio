			The Eiffel Information System (EIS) provides a unified mechanism for linking development objects - classes, features and so on - of Eiffel systems with external information. This term refers to information other than Eiffel program texts. Usually the tools maintaining external information are separate tools, such as a browser; we call them external tools. Examples of external information and possible corresponding external tools are:
		</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
		          <item> Web page - the default browser</item>
		          <item> PDF document - Acrobat</item>
		</list>
		<paragraph> 
			EIS is also intended to be the standard mechanism for obtaining help on Eiffel and EiffelStudio, replacing previous solutions. In that case external tools may actually be Eiffel tools.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The basic mechanisms that EIS makes available to users include two categories: outgoing (from Eiffel to external tools), incoming (the reverse).</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Examples of outgoing mechanisms include: </paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
		          <item> Annotating Eiffel targets, classes and features to include references to external information. Such annotations can include tags.</item>
		          <item> By selecting an annotation in EiffelStudio, automatically open the corresponding external tool to display or edit that information.</item>
		          <item> Provide a list of all external information (in a class, cluster or entire system) corresponding to a specified tag.</item>
		</list>
		<paragraph>Examples of incoming mechanisms include: </paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
		          <item> For supported tools, select external information linked to an Eiffel developer object and have EiffelStudio directly open on that object. In 6.2, eiffel: schema is supported on Windows.</item>
