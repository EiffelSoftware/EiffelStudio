		<H1>What's new in EiffelStudio 5.3</H1>
		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
		<h3>Changes</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>In project settings, we now accept a root class without creation 
          procedure.</li>
        </ul>
		<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
		<ul>
          <li>Fixed issue with setting of arguments. After restarting 
          EiffelStudio the command line argument contains an extra `]' 
          character.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue with working directories where only the first one ever 
          set was used even if new ones have been set afterwards.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue where generating documentation for all/library cluster 
          would stop during generation without completing.</li>
          <li>Fixed crash in diagram tool when moving label on client/supplier 
          link between two classes.</li>
          <li>Fixed resource leak on Windows 98 and Windows Me.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue in projects where clusters are specified with relative 
          path would not compile after adding a local assembly.</li>
          <li>Fixed problem with cluster tool management where moving classes 
          around or looking up a class will generate an error box instead of 
          performing the requested operation.</li>
          <li>Fixed incorrect Ace file specification for EiffelVision2 examples 
          and wizards on Unix platforms where application could be linked 
          dynamically with `libpng' but should not.</li>
          <li>Fixed disappearance of EiffelStudio when debugging a routine 
          `infix' or `prefix' in which an exception was raised. This issue was 
          only occurring with melted code (usually noticeable when using a 
          precompiled library).</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Compiler</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click
          <a href="../30_compiler/60_version_history/03_53_release/00_52_to_53_changes.html">here</a> 
          for the compiler release notes.</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Debugger</h2>
		<h2>Libraries</h2>
        <h3>CECIL</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Enforced definition of EIF_OBJECT so that it is different from 
          EIF_REFERENCE to better catch errors when passing a protected 
          reference to a feature accepting an unprotected reference and vice 
          versa. Because of this change some C code might not compile anymore 
          which is good as it points out that code was doing something wrong 
          that could corrupt the Eiffel memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelBase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Added in <span class="eclass">INTERNAL</span> the following new features: 
          <span class="efeature">field_static_type_of_type</span>, <span class="efeature">class_name_of_type</span>,
          <span class="efeature">type_name</span> and <span class="efeature">type_name_of_type</span>.<li>
          Added <span class="efeature">truncated_to_integer_64</span> in <span class="eclass">REAL</span> and <span class="eclass">DOUBLE</span>.
          <li>Added 
          <span class="efeature">to_integer_64</span> in <span class="eclass">STRING</span>.<li>
          Added new classes <span class="eclass">MEMORY_STRUCTURE</span>, <span class="eclass">MANAGED_POINTER</span> and
          <span class="eclass">C_STRING</span> to better manage access to C and 
          C++ memory structure.<li>
          Fixed incorrect implementation of <span class="efeature">area</span> and <span class="efeature">substring</span> for 
          <span class="eclass">STRING</span> in dotnet mode.<li>
          Fixed bug in <span class="efeature">copy</span> from <span class="eclass">STRING</span> where following code was violating `valid_count' 
          invariant from <span class="eclass">STRING</span>:
          <pre><span class="ekeyword">local</span>
	s, t: <span class="eclass">STRING</span>
<span class="ekeyword">do</span>
	<span class="ekeyword">create</span> s.<span class="efeature">make</span> (9)
	<span class="ekeyword">create</span> t.<span class="efeature">make</span> (10)
	t.<span class="efeature">append</span> (&quot;1234567890&quot;)
	s.<span class="efeature">copy</span> (t)
<span class="ekeyword">end</span></pre>
          <li>
          Added support for storable in .NET. However .NET and classic 
          implementation are completely different and <span class="efeature">independent_store</span> will 
          not be able to retrieve a storable file if not made using the same 
          code generation.<li>
          Fixed a bug in <span class="efeature">is_equal</span> from <span class="eclass">LIST</span> where comparing two lists of 
          different counts could break the comparison:<br>
<pre><span class="efeature">make</span> <span class="ekeyword">is</span>
	<span class="ekeyword">local</span>
		a, b: <span class="eclass">LIST</span> [<span class="eclass">INTEGER</span>]
	<span class="ekeyword">do</span>
		create {<span class="eclass">ARRAYED_LIST</span> [<span class="eclass">INTEGER</span>]} a.<span class="efeature">make</span> (2)
		a.<span class="efeature">extend</span> (10)

		create {<span class="eclass">ARRAYED_LIST</span> [<span class="eclass">INTEGER</span>]} b.<span class="efeature">make</span> (2)
		b.<span class="efeature">extend</span> (10)
		b.<span class="efeature">extend</span> (11)

		<span class="efeature">print</span> (<span class="efeature">equal</span> (b, a))
	<span class="ekeyword">end</span>
</pre><li>
          Fixed  .NET implementation of <span class="efeature">open_write</span> and <span class="efeature">create_read_write</span> 
          in <span class="eclass">FILE</span>. They 
          were not resetting the file size to zero if file already existed.</ul>
        <h3>Eiffel2Java</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Updated library so that it works both in classic and dotnet mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelCOM</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed crash in ccom_set_name from FONT_IMPL_PROXY.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelNet</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed assertion violation of call to <span class="efeature">to_integer</span> in feature <span class="efeature">get_content_length</span> from <span class="eclass">HTTP_PROTOCOL</span> 
          if assertions are enabled on EiffelBase.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelStore</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Updated library so that it works both in classic and dotnet mode.</li>
          <li>Fixed issue with oracle handle which did not work with the 
          included Borland C compiler.</li>
          <li>Removed <span class="efeature">nb_classes</span> from <span class="eclass">EXT_INTERNAL</span>.</li>
          <li>Removed need for additional object file (`support.lib' on windows 
          and `libsupport.a' on Unix platforms), so make sure to remove it from 
          your project configurations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelVision2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>

        </ul>
        <h3>WEL</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Removed inheritance to <span class="eclass">WEL_STRUCTURE</span> in <span class="eclass">WEL_STRING</span>, it now 
          inherits from new <span class="eclass">C_STRING</span> class.</li>
        </ul>
