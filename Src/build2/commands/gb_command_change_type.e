	old_object: GB_OBJECT
		-- Original object that was repaced.
		-- We restore this when we undo.

	original_type: STRING
		-- String representation of original object type.

	new_type: STRING
		-- String representation of type changed to.
	
	layout_item: GB_LAYOUT_CONSTRUCTOR_ITEM
		-- Layout item representing the object `Current' refers to.
		-- We cannot store the object, as changing the type
		-- creates a new object, therefore we have to do `layout_item.object'
		-- to retrieve the current object we are working with.
