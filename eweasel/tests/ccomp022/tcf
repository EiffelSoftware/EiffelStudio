test_name 	expanded-generic-dead-code
test_description A generic class has a routine with a local whose type is the formal generic parameter.  Another class inherits from the generic class and provides an expanded type as actual generic parameter, where the expanded type's base class has a creation procedure.  If the system is finalized with dead code removal on, the generated C code will compile but won't link.
