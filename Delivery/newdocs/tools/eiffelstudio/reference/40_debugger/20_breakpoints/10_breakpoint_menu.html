<h1>Breakpoint menu</h1>
<p>In all flat views (<A HREF="../../80_formatters/20_feature_formatters/10_flat_format.html">feature flat view</A> and
<A HREF="../../80_formatters/10_class_formatters/15_flat_format.html">class flat view</A>), a margin is displayed on the left
of the editor. <A HREF="00_introduction.html">Breakpoints</a> are there symbolized as circles, of a different
appearance depending on their state: enabled ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_bpenabled.gif"> ), disabled 
( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_bpdisabled.gif">  ) or not set 
( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_bpslot.gif"> ). A small question
mark in the circle indicates conditional breakpoints.<p>Right-clicking on any
breakpoint pops up a context menu:<P align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/debugger/breakpoint_context_menu.png"></P>
<p>Clicking
one of the three first entries of the context menu changes the state of the
breakpoint that was right-clicked. The last entry (<b>Run to breakpoint</b>)
launches the debugged application so that it will stop as soon as the selected
breakpoint is encountered, as if the breakpoint had been enabled.
