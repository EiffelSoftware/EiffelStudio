					<P>When discovering any approach to software construction, however ambitious
					its goals, it is reassuring to see first a small example of the big picture
					-- a complete program to print the famous "Hello World!" string.
					Here is how to perform this fascinating task in the Eiffel notation.</P>
					
					<P>You write a class <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">HELLO</SPAN> with a single
					procedure, say <SPAN CLASS="ee-text">make</SPAN>, also serving as creation
					procedure. If you like short texts, here is a minimal version:</P>
					
					<CODE>
						<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="eclass">HELLO</SPAN>
						<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">create</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="efeature">make</SPAN>
						<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">make</SPAN>
						<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">do</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN
						CLASS=efeature>print</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="esymbol">(</SPAN><SPAN
						CLASS=estring>"Hello World!%N"</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">)</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN></P>
						<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN> --
						<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">class </SPAN>HELLO</P>
					</CODE>

					<P>In practice, however, the Eiffel style rules suggest a better documented version:
					
					<CODE>
						<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">indexing</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eitag">description</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">:</SPAN>
						<SPAN CLASS="estring">"Root for trivial system printing a message"</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eitag">author</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">:</SPAN> <SPAN 
						CLASS=estring>"Elizabeth W. Brown"</SPAN></P>
						<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">HELLO</SPAN></P>
						<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">create</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">make</SPAN></P>
						<P> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">make</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Print a simple message.</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">do</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<SPAN CLASS="efeature">io</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="edot">.</SPAN><SPAN
						CLASS=efeature>put_string</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="esymbol">(</SPAN><SPAN
						CLASS=estring>"Hello World!"</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">)</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<SPAN CLASS="efeature">io</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="edot">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="efeature">put_new_line</SPAN></P>
						<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN></P>
						<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN> -- <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">class </SPAN>
						HELLO</P>
					</CODE>
	
					<P>The two versions perform identically; the following comments will cover the more
					complete second one.</P>

					<P>Note the absence of semicolons and other syntactic clatter or clutter. You may in
					fact use semicolons to separate instructions and declarations. But the language's
					syntax is designed to make the semicolon optional (regardless of text layout) and it's
					best for readability to omit it, except in the special case of successive elements on
					a single line.</P>
					
					<P>The <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">indexing</SPAN> clause does not affect execution semantics;
					you may use it to associate documentation with the class, so that browsers and other
					indexing and retrieval tools can help users in search of reusable components satisfying
					certain properties. Here we see two indexing entries, labeled <SPAN CLASS="eitag">
					description</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="eitag">author</SPAN>.</P>
					
					<P>The name of the class is <SPAN CLASS="eclass">HELLO</SPAN>. Any class may contain
					"features"; <SPAN CLASS="eclass">HELLO</SPAN> has just one, called
					<SPAN CLASS="efeature">make</SPAN>. The <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">create</SPAN> clause
					indicates that <SPAN CLASS="efeature">make</SPAN> is a "creation procedure", that is to
					say an operation to be executed at class instantiation time. The class could have any
					number of creation procedures.</P>
					
					<P>The definition of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">make</SPAN> appears in a
					<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN> clause. There may be any number of such clauses
					(to separate features into logical categories), and each may contain any number of
					feature declarations. Here we have only one.</P>
					
					<P>The line starting with <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">--</SPAN> (two hyphen signs) is a
					comment; more precisely it is a "header comment", which style rules invite software
					developers to write for every such feature, just after the
					<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">is</SPAN>. As will be seen in
					<A HREF="tutorial-09.html#pgfId-514906">"The contract form of a class"</A>, the tools of
					EiffelStudio know about this convention and use it to include the header comment in
					the automatically generated class documentation.</P>
					
					<P>The body of the feature is introduced by the <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">do</SPAN>
					keyword and terminated by <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>. It consists of two output
					instructions. They both use <SPAN CLASS="efeature">io</SPAN>, a generally available
					reference to an object that provides access to standard input and output mechanisms;
					the notation <SPAN CLASS="efeature">io</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="edot">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="efeature">f</SPAN>,
					for some feature <SPAN CLASS="efeature">f</SPAN> of the corresponding library class
					(<SPAN CLASS="eclass">STD_FILES</SPAN>), means "apply <SPAN CLASS="efeature">f</SPAN>
					to <SPAN CLASS="efeature">io</SPAN>". Here we use two such features:</P>
					
					<UL>
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="efeature">put_string</SPAN> outputs a string, passed as argument,
						here <SPAN CLASS="estring">"Hello World"</SPAN>.</LI>
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="efeature">put_new_line</SPAN> terminates the line.</LI>
					</UL>
					
					<P>Rather than using a call to <SPAN CLASS="efeature">put_new_line</SPAN>, the first
					version of the class simply includes a new-line character, denoted as
					<SPAN CLASS="estring">%N</SPAN>, at the end of the string. Either technique is acceptable.</P>
