test_name 	who-gets-old-exception
test_description A routine has a postcondition with an `old' expression which involves a function call.  An exception is raised during execution of this function.  If the system is frozen, the recipient of the exception is not the routine containing the `old' expression, but that routine's caller.  If the system is melted, the routine containing the `old' expression is the recipient of the exception.
