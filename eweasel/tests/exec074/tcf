test_name 	 big-array-of-bit
test_description A class creates an ARRAY [BIT 32] and fills it with elements of type BIT 32.  Executing the system results in a run-time panic if the size of the array is big enough (approximately 4500), but only if garbage collection is on.  If garbage collection is off, a 500_000 element array works fine.
