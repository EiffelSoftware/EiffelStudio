		<H1>Creating a Library Object</H1>
		<P>
			To Create a DESC object representing a library and load that library,
			use  a declaration such as:
			<P CLASS="code">
				<SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">:</SPAN>
				<SPAN CLASS="eclass"><A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">
				DLL_32</A></SPAN>
			</P>
		<P>
			where <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN> should be replaced by whatever name you have chosen to
			denote the library in your software, and execute a creation instruction of the form:
			<P CLASS="code">
				<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">create</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="elocal">make</SPAN>
				(<SPAN CLASS="estring">"your_lib_name"</SPAN>)
			</P>
		<P>
			where <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_lib_name</SPAN> is the name of the file containing the library.
		<P>
			After this call has been executed, the boolean value <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll.meaningful</SPAN>
			will be true if and only if the creation has been successful, that is to say, the
			given name did correspond to an available library, and it was possible to load it.
		<P>
			If <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll.meaningful</SPAN> is false, you can have more details about the error
			by comparing the value of <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll.error_code</SPAN>, an integer, to those of
			constant attributes defined in class <A HRE
			Two classes, <A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A> and
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_routine_chart.html">DLL_32_ROUTINE</A>
			, supported by an auxiliary class <A HREF="../../reference/desc/general/shared_library_constants_chart.html">
			SHARED_LIBRARY_CONSTANTS</A>. As expressed by an invariant of class
			<A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">DLL_32</A>, the value of
			<SPAN CLASS="elocal">meaningful</SPAN> is true if an only if <SPAN CLASS="elocal">error_code</SPAN>
			= <SPAN CLASS="elocal">0</SPAN>.
