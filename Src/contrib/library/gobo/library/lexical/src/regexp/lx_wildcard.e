		"Wildcards used in filename pattern matching"

	remark: "[
  		Pattern syntax:
		x          match the character 'x'.
		?          any character except '/'.
		*          zero or more occurrences of any character except '/'.
		**/        zero or more occurrences of (one or more characters other
		           than '/', followed by '/').
		\X         if 'X' is an 'a', 'b', 'f', 'n', 'r', 't', or 'v', then
		           the ANSI-C interpretation of \X. Otherwise, a literal 'X'
		           (used to escape operators such as '*').
		\0         a null character (ASCII code 0).
		\123       the character with octal value 123.
		\x2a       the character with hexadecimal value 2a.
		[xyz]      a character class; in this case, the pattern matches
		           either an 'x', a 'y' or a 'z'.
		[abj-oZ]   a character class with a range in it; matches an 'a', a
		           'b', any letter from 'j' through 'o', or a 'Z'.
		[^A-Z]     a negated character class, i.e., any character but those
		           in the class. In this case, any character except an
		           uppercase letter.
		[^A-Z\n]   any character except an uppercase letter or a newline.
		wv         the wildcard w followed by the wildcard v; called
		           concatenation.
		"[xyz]\"foo"     the literal string: '[xyz]"foo'.
		?(pattern-list)  zero or one occurrence of the given patterns.
		*(pattern-list)  zero or more occurrences of the given patterns.
		+(pattern-list)  one or more occurrences of the given patterns.
		@(pattern-list)  exactly one of the given patterns.
		                 where pattern-list is a list of one or more
		                 patterns separated by a '|'.
