	description: "[
		Condition variables allow threads to synchronize based on the content of a shared data, whereas
		mutexes only synchronize access to the data. In other words, a condition variable is a
		synchronization object that enables threads to wait until a particular condition occurs.
		
		When a thread executes a `wait' call on a condition variable, it must hold an associated `mutex'
		(used for checking that condition). Then, it is immediately suspended and put into the waiting
		queue. The thread is suspended and is waiting for the condition to occur.

		Eventually, when the condition has occurred, a thread will `signal' it. Two possible scenarios:
		- if there are threads waiting, then one of the waiting thread will resume its execution and
		  will get the `mutex' in a locked state.
		- if there are no threads waiting, nothing is done

		For the simple usage of a condition variable, it is very similar to using a semaphore.
		
		In addition you have `broadcast' that will resume all waiting threads at once, and
		`wait_with_timeout' that will wait only a certain amount of time before abandonning the wait.
		
		The `signal' and `broadcast' routines can be called by a thread whether or not it currently owns
		the mutex that threads calling `wait' or `wait_with_timeout' have associated with the condition
		variable during their waits. If, however, predictable scheduling behavior is required, then that
		mutex should be locked by the thread prior to calling `signal' or `broadcast'.
		
		Assuming `shared_data' an INTEGER initially set to zero, then a typical usage of condition variable
		to wait until `shared_data' becomes one, could be written as followed in thread A:
		
			mutex.lock
			from
			until
				shared_data = 1
			loop
				condition_variable.wait (mutex)
			end
			mutex.unlock
			
		and in thread B:
		
			mutex.lock
			shared_data := 1
			condition_variable.signal
			mutex.unlock
			
		Thread A will be blocked until thread B signal that now `shared_data' is 1.
