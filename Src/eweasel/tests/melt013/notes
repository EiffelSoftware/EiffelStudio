After initial compilation where the system is frozen, an attribute is
changed from a BIT_REF to a BOOL_STRING and the instruction which
creates it is modified accordingly and changes are melted.  System
execution then ends with a run-time panic which states "invalid
assertion level".

Discovered in Release 3.2.2.
