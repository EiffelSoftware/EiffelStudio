An expanded class which has more than one creation procedure in
separate Creation_clause's violates the Creation_clause rule VGCP(4)
but the compiler does not complain.  Actually, the example class does
not technically violate VGCP(4), but it violates the spirit of this
constraint since the class will never be able to be used as an
expanded type.

Discovered in Release 3.1.1.
