A class has a routine which repeatedly creates a manifest array, each
of whose elements is `strip ()'.  The class has one attribute, of type
ARRAY [ANY].  Executing the system results in a run-time panic.
Reducing the number of "strip ()" elements below 49 or turning off
garbage collection allows the system to execute correctly for a huge
number of iterations.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
