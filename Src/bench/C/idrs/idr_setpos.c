	Internal data representation.

	All those calls exactly mimic their xdr counterpart as far as the
	interface goes. Of course, the internal coding may differ :-)

	NOTA BENE: By definition, this is NOT portable. However, it should work
	correctly when short is two bytes, int is either a short or a long and
	long is four bytes. Moreover, there must be no internal difference between
	a signed and an unsigned entity (for the "container").
