The EiffelStore library provides a consistent set of 
classes for writing object oriented Eiffel applications that need 
to handle persistent objects.

The library interface consists of two sets:

1) A set of general purpose classes designed regardless of any data 
 management system used, to be found in directory 
 $EIFFEL4/library/store/interface, and that you always need in your universe

2) Specific classes, referred to by the interface classes, bridging
  the application to selected data management systems called ``handles''. 
  The set of handles may be found:

   * in directory $EIFFEL4/library/store/dbms

   * in the directory $EIFFEL4/library/store/dbms/rdbms/{server_name}   
   with {server_name} corresponding to a selected relational database 
   management system.

   Additional support classes are also needed in your universe
   regardless of the selected handle. They are located in:
   
   * directory $EIFFEL4/library/store/support and 
      $EIFFEL4/library/store/dbms/support
   
Example classes are located in $EIFFEL4/examples/store

EiffelStore 4.3 has currently only been tested with:
		ISE-Eiffel Release 4.3
   		Oracle8 8.0.3
		Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise for Windows NT Evaluation Copy
 Version 11.5
		IngresII
		ODBC 3.0

Documentation
-------------
   The user's manual is in Postscript format in directory /doc
   (cover page + content in US LTR format)

Then, to install EiffelStore external libraries, go to directory 
$EIFFEL4/library/store/install (a README file provides full instructions).

Then, making sure that you have the requested database (Oracle,
Sybase, etc) call: 
   make_Clib 
from inside this current EiffelStore directory.

In the case of Oracle, make sure you are registered as an Oracle user.

Note
----
If you are using EiffelStore with a specific RDBMS, read carefully
the following file:
   $EIFFEL4/library/store/install/{basename}.txt
