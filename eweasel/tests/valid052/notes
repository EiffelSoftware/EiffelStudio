Depending on the order of formal generic parameters in a class (one
constrained and one unconstrained), the compiler interprets G as
either a formal generic or as a class.  It seems that if there is a
class G, then G should be interpreted as a class (and a VCFG error
signaled).  If there is no class G, then G should always be treated as
a formal generic parameter, regardless of order.
