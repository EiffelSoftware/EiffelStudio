test_name 	 unreachable-syntax-error
test_description A system with two classes is compiled.  The compiler detects the syntax error on the second class.  Then the root class is changed so that the second class is no longer reachable from the root.  When compilation is resumed, the compiler still reports a syntax error on the unreachable class.
