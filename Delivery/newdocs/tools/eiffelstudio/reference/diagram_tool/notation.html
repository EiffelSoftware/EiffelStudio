		<H1>Notation</H1>

		<P>The diagram tool uses the <A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/products/bon.html">BON</A> (Business Object Notation) to represent Eiffel systems. This article will give a summary of all components of an EiffelBench diagram. For detailed information on BON, please read <A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/documentation.html#soosa">Seamless Object-Oriented Software Architecture</A> by Kim Waldén and Jean-Marc Nerson, Prentice Hall 1994.</P>

		<H2>Class</H2>

		<P>
		<IMG SRC="../../../../images/EiffelBench/bon-class.png" ALIGN="right">
		An object class is represented by an ellipse (sometimes referred to as <I>bubble</I>). It contains the class name and formal generics of the Eiffel class it represents. Second, it displays information about properties of a class. These properties are:

		<UL>
			<LI><U>Deferred</U>: class is declared as <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">deferred</SPAN>.
				<P><IMG SRC="../../../../images/EiffelBench/bon-class-deferred.png">
			<LI><U>Effective</U>: class is not <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">deferred</SPAN> and has at least one <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">deferred</SPAN> parent, or redefines one ore more features.
				<P><IMG SRC="../../../../images/EiffelBench/bon-class-effective.png">
			<LI><U>Persistent</U>: class inherits <SPAN CLASS="eclass">STORABLE</SPAN> or has indexing tag <SPAN CLASS="eitag">persistent</SPAN>.
				<P><IMG SRC="../../../../images/EiffelBench/bon-class-persistent.png">
			<LI><U>Interfaced</U>: class has one ore more <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">external</SPAN> features.
				<P><IMG SRC="../../../../images/EiffelBench/bon-class-interfaced.png">
			<LI><U>Reused</U>: class resides in a precompiled library or in a <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">library</SPAN> cluster.
				<P><IMG SRC="../../../../images/EiffelBench/bon-class-reused.png">
			<LI><U>Root class</U>: class has the program's entry point.

		<H2>Cluster</H2>

		<P>
		A cluster is a collection of classes and subclusters. It is represented by a stippled, rounded rectangle. The cluster name is in a similar rectangle, by default located at the top of the cluster just outside of it. A cluster can be iconified, which means it is minimized to take up as less space as possible.

		<H2>Inheritance links</H2>

		<P>
		Inheritance between classes is represented by a red arrow from a class to its parent. Typically, inheritance links point upwards.

		<H2>Client/supplier links</H2>

		<P>
		Client relationships between classes are represented by a blue arrow with a double line from the client to the supplier. Typically, these links point to the right. A special kind of relationship is the aggregate client/supplier link. Aggregate means that the supplier is an integral part of the client. In the class text, it corresponds to <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">expanded</SPAN> features. In the diagram, an aggregate link has a little line along the back side of the arrow.
