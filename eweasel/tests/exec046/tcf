test_name 	 class-invariant-fail-panic
test_description The creation procedure of the root class repeatedly calls another routine, which has a rescue clause.  This latter routine has a qualified call of an exported feature in a class which has a class invariant.  If assertion level `invariant' is specified *and* the class invariant is violated, system execution quickly ends with a panic.  Also, once the class invariant is violated, it is never checked again.
