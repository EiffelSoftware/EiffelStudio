<h1>Introduction</h1>
<P align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/debugger/object_tool.png"></P>
<p>The object tool is a debugging tool that displays extended dynamic information
concerning one or several objects while debugging an application. This
information includes the value of all their attributes, as well as the value of
the once functions that were already called.
<p>

It is mainly composed of two trees, the 
<A HREF="05_local_view.html">local view</a> and the 
<A HREF="10_object_view.html">object view</a>. In the
toolbar are located two commands that facilitate browsing the trees: the 
<A HREF="20_slice_size_command.html">remove object command</a> and the 
<A HREF="30_remove_object_command.html">set slice size command</a>.
