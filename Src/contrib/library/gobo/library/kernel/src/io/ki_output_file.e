	open_append
			-- Open current file in append mode if it

			-- If the file is successfully opened, it is
			-- either created if it didn't exist or the
			-- data which will be written to the file will
			-- appear after its old content otherwise.

	recursive_open_write
			-- Open current file in write-only mode if
			-- it can be opened, let it closed otherwise.
			-- If the file is successfully opened, it is
			-- either created if it didn't exist or its
			-- old content is removed otherwise. Try to
			-- recursively create its parent directory
			-- if it does not exist yet.
