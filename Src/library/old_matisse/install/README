Installation 

1. Make sure the environment variables EIFFEL4 and PLATFORM are set.

2. Configure your setup for the database

3. Install the C-libraries:

   Start your databases kernels if needed (most of the C-libraries are based
   on DBMS libraries, but some of them use a precompiler which needs to acces
   the database kernel).

	type "finish_freezing" in the following directories:

	$EIFFEL4/library/store/date_and_time/Clib
	$EIFFEL4/library/store/support/Clib

	and in the directory specific to the handle you are using. For instance,
	for the Ingres handle:

	$EIFFEL4/library/store/dbms/rdbms/ingres/Clib
