After initial compilation, an attribute listed in a strip expression
is changed to a constant attribute, which elicits a VWST(1) error
report.  Then an inheritance clause is added and the constant
attribute is moved to an heir class.  The compiler still reports
VWST(1), but cannot find the feature name (it says "Exception occurred
while displaying error message.").  Resuming compilation causes a
segmentation fault and license is not returned.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
