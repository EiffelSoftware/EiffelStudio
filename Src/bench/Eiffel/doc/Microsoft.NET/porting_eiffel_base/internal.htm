<h1>INTERNAL</h1>
<h2>Used .NET classes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>TYPE, OBJECT (ANY)
</ul>
<h2>Static methods used</h2>
<ul>
	<li>{ANY}.get_type, get_type_string
</ul>
<h2>Security notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When retrieving members of a type, all members are returned, but this needs ReflectionPermission.
</ul>
<h2>Unhandled exceptions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>SecurityException is raised when attempting to read members of a type without ReflectionPermission.
</ul>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>Since I don't see what stands for expanded types and BIT, there are empty locations in the list of known types.
BIT has to be fixed when there is a convention for namespaces.
For the same reason, CHARACTER and WIDE_CHARACTER are equivalent.
<p>Didn't find how to implement generic_dynamic_type.
<p>Field_offset is pretty random, just as bit_size and physical_size ^.^
<p>compiler_version has to be built-in, just as it is in normal Eiffel.
