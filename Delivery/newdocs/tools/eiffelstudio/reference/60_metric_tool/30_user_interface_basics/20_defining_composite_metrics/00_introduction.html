        <h1>Defining, loading, managing new metrics</h1>
        <p>Users
        should have the ability to define a new derived or composite metric by
        applying some of the selection criteria or composition operators to one
        or more existing metrics.

        </p>
        <p>They
        should also have the ability to save all current metric definitions to a
        file, producing a <b>metric definition record</b>. This should not be
        confused with a measurement archive, which records the results of measures
        resulting from applying certain metrics to certain projects.

        </p>
        <p>Although
        the concepts are distinct, ISE Eiffel lets you store a measurement
        archive and the corresponding metric definition record into a single
        file, so that when you access the archived measures you have an unambiguous
        definition of the metrics that served to produce them.

        </p>
        <p>The
        environment must also provide a way of adding a set of metrics read from a metric definition
        record,
        available from a local file, to the current metric
        definitions. As a result, users
        will be able to benefit from each other’s metric definitions and
        improve them over time.
