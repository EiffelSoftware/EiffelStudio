<h1>Basic text view</h1>
<p>Basic text view <img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_format_text_color.gif"> is the only
editable view; this is why it is only available through the
<a href="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/20_editor/index.html">editor</a>.
<P align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/class_mini_format_bar.png"></P>
This is also the view selected by default when the editor is opened for the first time.
<p>In this view, most of the development objects are <a href="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">clickable</a>,
except for special cases like assertions, anchored types, identifiers within a comment line... for which
the <a href="./10_clickable_format.html">clickable view</a> might be needed.
<p><b>Note</b>: The generated text is not editable, but it is compilable.&nbsp;
This view is not available to .NET classes which are imported through by means
of an assembly.&nbsp; This is because the assembly .exe or .dll exposes only the
interface methods and therefore is no implementation to display.&nbsp; Such
classes may be viewed, in a clickable format using the Contract View or
Interface View.
