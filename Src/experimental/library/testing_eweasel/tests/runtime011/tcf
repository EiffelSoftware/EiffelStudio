test_name	tuple-special-twin-bug
test_description If we create a lot of TUPLEs whose physical size is larger than what they really need to be and try to copy it in a TUPLE of a smaller physical size (even though both TUPLE have the same count) we could corrupt the TUPLE memory. Same goes with SPECIAL.
