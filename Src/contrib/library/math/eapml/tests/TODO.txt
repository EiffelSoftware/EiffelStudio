Test suite order - 

-Interfaces must be tested first (string conversions, Eiffel native construction conversions, etc, using known good large numbers verified by other big number libraries.
(If we don't have at least this then nothing else can be trusted)

-Integer Interfaces
-Real Interfaces
	* Real MPF
	* Real MPFR
-Rational
-Complex Integer
-Complex Complex Real
	* Complex Real MPF
	* Complex Real MPFR
-Complex Rational



-Test arithmetic functions for each eiffel MP constrcts using known values/solutions for "big" numbers and checking using previously tested known-good interfaces.

	*Test arithmetic operations between similar types of MP constructs
	*Test arithmetic operations between different types of MP constructs
