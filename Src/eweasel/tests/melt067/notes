A root class has an attribute of type `expanded TEST1 [STRING]' where
the creation procedure of TEST1 declares a local of type `expanded
TEST2 [like Current]' and prints its generating type.  Code compiles
fine when melted, but dies with a panic when executed.  Frozen and
finalized code work correctly.

Discovered in release 5.4.0515.
