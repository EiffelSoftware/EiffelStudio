<h1>Proposed new architecture for defining the place of Eiffel classes in the 
.NET world</h1>
<p>Class <span class="eclass">ANY</span> is the same in classic Eiffel and Eiffel for .NET. It does not 
inherit from anything. Instead, the class <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>, is, like any other 
class, a descendant of <span class="eclass">ANY</span>. <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span> has the 
following role:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any non-Eiffel .NET class is automatically considered a descendant of 
	<span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>.</li>
	<li>Eiffel classes can also be descendants of <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>, either by 
	inheriting directly from this class or (the more commonly useful scenario) 
	by inheriting from a non-Eiffel .NET class or interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Class <span class="eclass">ANY</span> appears as:</p>
<pre>class <span class="eclass">ANY</span>
convert
	to_dotnet: {<span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>}
...
end</pre>
<p>In other words it has <b>one</b> new feature, a conversion function <span class="efeature">to_dotnet</span>: {<span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>} 
which is also present in classic Eiffel but with a precondition restricting its 
use to .NET mode.<br>
<br>
There is one <i>magic</i> rule: any descendant of <span class="eclass">ANY</span> 
that is not a descendant of <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span> also 
automatically admits <span class="efeature">to_dotnet</span> as conversion 
procedure, as if it had the same <span class="ekeyword">convert</span> clause as <span class="eclass">ANY</span> above. This means that 
one can pass any Eiffel object to a .NET routine accepting values of type 
System.Object.</p>
<p>Where <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span> 
is defined as follows, providing access to the universal features of .NET (`get_type' 
etc.):</p>
<pre>
class <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>
inherit
	<span class="eclass">ANY</span>
		redefine
			all
		end
feature -- Comparison
	equals (other: <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>): <span class="eclass">BOOLEAN</span>
	equals (a, b: <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>): <span class="eclass">BOOLEAN</span>
	reference_equals (other: <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>): <span class="eclass">BOOLEAN</span>
	
feature -- Access
	get_hash_code: <span class="eclass">INTEGER</span>
	get_type: <span class="eclass">TYPE</span>
	
feature -- Output
	to_string: <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_STRING</span>
	
feature {NONE}
	finalize
	frozen memberwise_clone: <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>
end</pre>
<p>where `redefine all end' means that all routines inherited from
	<span class="eclass">ANY</span> are re-implemented specifically for .NET 
external classes.<br>
<br>
As a result of these rules, all classes are descendants of
	<span class="eclass">ANY</span>, following with the usual Eiffel rule. This 
means that one can use ordinary Eiffel container classes, in particular those of 
EiffelBase and EiffelVision, to store and retrieve any .NET object, whether an 
instance of an Eiffel class or of a non-Eiffel class, without any particular 
action on the programmer's side.<br>
<br>
The other way round, as noted, Eiffel objects can be passed directly as 
arguments to .NET routines.<br>
<br>
Breaking change: to call a .NET (non-Eiffel) universal feature -- i.e. a feature 
of <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>, such as get_type -- on an Eiffel 
object, you may not any more use e.g. a.get_type, but must write<br>
<br>
a.to_dotnet.get_type<br>
<br>
This is probably a good thing for clarity. We expect the call to <span class="efeature">to_dotnet</span> 
will be free performance-wise.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the big 
question is how to perform the dynamic binding.</p>
<p>Given</p>
<pre>a, b: ANY
a.is_equal (b)
</pre>
<p>we need to ensure that this code works even when `a' is attached to .NET 
type. I believe that we can achieve that by checking which routine Id is called and if it is one of 
the predefined one from ANY then we generate 
a special code that does a branching such as:</p>
<pre>intermediate: <span class="eclass">SYSTEM_OBJECT</span>
intermediate ?= a
if intermediate /= Void then
	feature {<span class="eclass">ISE_RUNTIME</span>}.is_equal (a, b)
else
	a.is_equal (b)
end</pre>
