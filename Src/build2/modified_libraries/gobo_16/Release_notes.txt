HACT 3.0 (Halstenbach)

ISE 4.5 (ISE Eiffel)

SE -0.76 (SmallEiffel)

    . Although this is perfectly correct Eiffel, SmallEiffel complains about
      Eiffel identifiers containing upper-case letters. There is a lot of
      these identifiers automatically generated by `gelex' and `geyacc'. In
      order to avoid being overwhelmed by zillions of unjustified warning
      messages, please use the option -no_style_warning.
