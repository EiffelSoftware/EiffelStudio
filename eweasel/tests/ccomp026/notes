A system has a class with an external routine and another class which
inherits the first class and undefines the external routine.  There is
also a call to the undefined version of the external routine (which
cannot work at run-time, of course).  When the system is finalized,
the generated C code won't compile.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
