This example illustrates the way one can convert
Unix flat files into class instances.

Changing a field (it's type or format) in an 
example.dat file, highlights the parser error 
detection mechanism.

When the example has been compiled, put the two
files "example1.dat" and "example2.dat" in the
directory "EIFGENs/W_CODE" or in "EIFGENs/F_code"
directory depending on your type of Eiffel
compilation.
