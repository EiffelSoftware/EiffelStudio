			RULE #46: Avoid 'not equal' in If-Else instructions
	
			Having an If-Else instruction with a
			condition that checks for inequality is not optimal for readability.
			Instead an equality comparison should be made. Refactoring by negating
			the condition and by switching the instructions solves this issue.
