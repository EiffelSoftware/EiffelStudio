<h1>Looking for a feature</h1>
There are many ways to find a feature in a class. In particular :
<ul>
<li>
You can use the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/30_feature_tool/00_introduction.html">feature
tool</a> and search the tree by expanding feature clauses. This tool, however,
displays only the features that are defined or redefined in the current
class text. If you do not know if the feature is inherited or not, you
may therefore not find what you are looking for with this method.</li>

<li>
You can also use the <a href="../../../reference/80_formatters/10_class_formatters/00_introduction.html">class
tab</a> in the context tool. It will allow you to see all the <a href="../../../reference/80_formatters/10_class_formatters/50_attributes_format.html">attributes</a>
or <a href="../../../reference/80_formatters/10_class_formatters/55_routines_format.html">routines</a>,
or all the <a href="../../../reference/80_formatters/10_class_formatters/75_exported_format.html">public
features</a> for instance. If you do not know if the feature you seek is
an attributes or a function and if it is public, this may not be the right
method either.</li>

<li>
If you know the name or a part of the name of the feature you are looking
for, the easier and faster way will probably be to use the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/10_address_bars/10_main_address_bar.html">address
bar</a>. If you type this name in the feature field of the bar (using "*"
and "?" wildcards if you want to), the editor will be centered on the right
class if necessary (i.e. if the feature is inherited) and scroll to the
position of the text of the feature.</li>
</ul>
