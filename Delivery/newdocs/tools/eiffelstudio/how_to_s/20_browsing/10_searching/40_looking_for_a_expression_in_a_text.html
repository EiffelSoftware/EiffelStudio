<h1>
Looking for an expression</h1>
To find a word or an expression in a text, you can use the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/60_search_tool.html">search
tool</a>. If it is not displayed, you can make it appear by clicking on
its icon&nbsp;<img SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_search_text_color.gif" >
in the tool bar. This tool will allow you to search a word or an expression
with wildcards ("?" or "*") and to replace it if you want to. It can be
case sensitive and look for isolated words.

<p CLASS="Note"><b>Note</b>: The <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/60_search_tool.html">search
tool</a> will look for the wanted word in the editor or in the context
tool, depending on which one has the focus.</P>

<p CLASS="tip"><b>Tip</b>: There are several accelerators that will make
it even easier to perform a search. They are detailed in the <a href="../../../reference/20_editor/50_search_functionality.html">editor
help</a>.</P>
