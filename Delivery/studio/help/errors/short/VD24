Configuration error: cluster contains conflicting declaration for basic class.
What to do: choose the appropriate version of the class; exclude
  the other from system (by moving it to another directory, or
  by using the Lace Exclude clause, see ETL D.9, p. 524);
  or if class is needed change its name it to remove the conflict.
