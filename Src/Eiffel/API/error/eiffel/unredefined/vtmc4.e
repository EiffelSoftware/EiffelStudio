	description: "[
					Error which reports that a features result type was redefined differently.
					This error occurs in the context of multi constraints.
					Martins 5/7/2007: This is an unoffical error! Not ECMA approved!
					
					Example:
					  class A
					  feature
					    f: ANY
					  end
					  
					  class B
					  inherit A redefine f end
					  feature
					    f: INTEGER
					  end
					  
					  class C
					  inherit A redefine f end
					  feature
					    f: STRING
					  end
					  
					  class NON_MULTI
					  feature
					    a: A
					    example: ANY
					      do
					         Result := a.f.is_equal (3) -- @1
					      end
					      
					  class MULTI [G -> {B, C}]
					  inherit NON_MULTI redefine a end
					  feature
					    a: G
					  end
					  
					Where is the problem?
					In the context of `MULTI' the feature `example' has an ambiguous call @1.
					This is because f occurs redefined in B and C and, assuming that the signature of
					`is_equal' is `like Current' this would yield to a CAT call in case an actual formal derivation
					would not select the version of from B but the one from C (which is STRING, not INTEGER).
					Even though one could check all possibilities to find out whether there is a problem or not, we
					decided to throw an error: VTMC4
