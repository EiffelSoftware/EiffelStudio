		<h1>Genericity</h1>
		<P>
			We got a very short introduction to&nbsp;
			<MSHELP:LINK tabIndex="0" indexMoniker="!DefaultKeywordIndex" keywords="generic class">generic
classes</MSHELP:LINK>
when we were looking at the formal generic part of class structure in <A href="../../eiffel_dotnet_language/20_language/10_eiffel_classes.html">
				Eiffel Classes</A>. That discussion left to the imagination the motivation
			and benefits for creating generic classes.
		</P>
		<P>You will see that most of the generic classes model containers for multiple
			items and at least one of their formal generic parameters represents the type
			of items that are to be stored in the container. Some generic classes, like
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LINKABLE</SPAN>, care for only one instance of the type represented by their formal
			generic parameter.</P>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<P>Imagine that a software producer is planning to build a class which would
			represent a list of things. Some one might ask "What kinds of things?" To which
			the producer would reply, "Just things. I want my list to be usable for all
			kinds of things."</P>
			<P>Using the idea of polymorphic attachment that we learned in&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_dotnet_language/20_language/30_inheritance.html">Inheritance</A>,
			the producer could build such a class. It might have a&nbsp;query&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN>
			which would return the thing from the list to which a cursor currently points.
			It might have a command <SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> which would enter some new thing into the list.</P>
		<P>What would be the type of <SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN>? And what would be the type of the argument to
			<SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN>?</P>
		<P>If the producer wants the class to handle all kinds of things, then the answer
			must be class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">ANY</SPAN>, the class from which all others inherit.
		</P>
		<CODE>
			<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST_OF_THINGS</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</P>
			<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Access</SPAN></P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">ANY</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- The thing
				currently pointed to by cursor</SPAN></P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</P>
			<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Element change</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">new_item</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">ANY</SPAN>)&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Add
				`new_item' at the end of the list</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>This will work, but has some definite disadvantages. Suppose you choose to use
			this class to maintain a list of cats in one of your classes. You might make
			this declaration:</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST_OF_THINGS</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment"> -- A list of
				my cats</SPAN></P>
		</CODE>
		<P>Then you could add individual instances to the list:</P>
		<CODE>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">fluffy</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="efeature">twinkie</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">CAT</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">fluffy</SPAN>)<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">twinkie</SPAN>)<BR>
		</CODE>
		<P>One problem with this type of list is that the type system will not help you
			keep from doing something pathological like:</P>
		<CODE>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">fluffy</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="efeature">twinkie</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">CAT</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">thor</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">PSYCHOTIC_HYDROPHOBIC_CAT_HATING_DOG</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">fluffy</SPAN>)<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">twinkie</SPAN>)<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="efeature">thor</SPAN>)<BR>
		</CODE>
		<P>Another problem is that to do any CAT things with an item in the list, you must
			reattach it to a CAT entity. The following is invalid.</P>
		<CODE>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">purr</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Is invalid</SPAN></P>
		</CODE>
		<P>This is because "item" is type ANY and although it may be currently attached to
			an instance of CAT, the static typing system cannot guarantee that. So you must
			use assignment attempt as we saw in the polymorphism example in <A href="../../eiffel_dotnet_language/20_language/30_inheritance.html">
				Inheritance</A>.</P>
		<CODE>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">some_cat</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">CAT</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">some_cat</SPAN> ?= <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">if</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="efeature">some_cat</SPAN> /= <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">Void</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">then</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">some_cat</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="efeature">purr</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">end</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
		</CODE>
		<P>You can see that this type of list has its drawbacks. Of course you could build
			a <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST_OF_CATS</SPAN> class in which <SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN> and the argument for <SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> would be of
			type <SPAN CLASS="eclass">CAT</SPAN>. This would let you <SPAN CLASS="efeature">purr</SPAN> a cat without pulling it out of the list,
			and it would also prevent you from accidently letting old Thor in with the
			cats. But, every time you needed a list to hold a different type of object, you
			have to write a new class.
		</P>
		<P>Indeed, this is how things are done in&nbsp;environements&nbsp;without
			facilities&nbsp;genericity.</P>
		<P>What we would like to have is a way to produce the text of the list class once.
			Then only when we make declarations do we add the additional information about
			the particular types we want allowed in the list.</P>
		<H2>Basic Genericity</H2>
		<P>In Eiffel this is accomplished through generic classes. Generic classes are
			written relative not to a specific class but to a kind of phony class name
			called a formal generic parameter. With genericity, the <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST_OF_THINGS</SPAN> class
			might become a class called <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN> which is a list of items of type <SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN>.
			In class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN> we would declare <SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN> as type G, as
			well as the argument to <SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN>.
		</P>
		<CODE>
			<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN> [<SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
			<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Access</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">item</SPAN>:&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="ecomment">--
				The&nbsp;item currently pointed to by cursor</SPAN><BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<BR>
			<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">feature</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment"> -- Element change</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <SPAN CLASS="efeature">put</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="eitag">new_item</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN>)&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="ecomment">-- Add
				`new_item' at the end of the list&nbsp;</SPAN><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;<BR>
		</CODE>
		<P>We could declare feature <SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN> as a <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN> of items of type <SPAN CLASS="eclass">CAT</SPAN>. By doing so
			we are providing <SPAN CLASS="eclass">CAT</SPAN> as an "actual generic parameter" in the declaration. Then
			we are free to treat the features of&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN> as if&nbsp;the class name
			<SPAN CLASS="eclass">CAT</SPAN>&nbsp;had been&nbsp;substituted for every occurrence of the formal generic
			parameter <SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN>.</P>
		<CODE>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="efeature">my_cats</SPAN>: <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN> [<SPAN CLASS="eclass">CAT</SPAN>]<BR>

		<H2>Constrained Genericity</H2>
		<P>The generic class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN> illustrated above is perfectly useful for making typed
			lists of any type of object. The features of the <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN> will not attempt to use
			the objects in the list in any way. Sometimes though, it is important for a
			class to be guaranteed more about the nature of the types that can be
			substituted for its formal generic parameter.</P>
		<P>Take for example the case of a class called <SPAN CLASS="eclass">SORTED_LIST</SPAN>. A <SPAN CLASS="eclass">SORTED_LIST</SPAN> is a
			list, of course, but it is special in that it acts upon the elements that it
			holds&nbsp;to keep them&nbsp;in order.
		</P>
		<P>A <SPAN CLASS="eclass">SORTED_LIST</SPAN> needs to be able to order its elements. So, it must be able to
			apply queries to those elements to determine which should sort high than which.
			The elements themselves must respond to ordering operations.</P>
		<P>If <SPAN CLASS="eclass">SORTED_LIST</SPAN> were defined like we did <SPAN CLASS="eclass">LIST</SPAN></P>
		<CODE>
			<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">SORTED_LIST</SPAN> [<SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>there would be no guarantee that ordering operations, like "&lt;" and "&gt;"
			could be applied to all types that could be listed.&nbsp;An
			Eiffel&nbsp;facility called "constrained genericity" will solve this problem
			for us. In the case of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">SORTED_LIST</SPAN>, we would add to the formal generic part as
			follows.</P>
		<CODE>
			<P><SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">class</SPAN>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN CLASS="eclass">SORTED_LIST</SPAN> [<SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN> -&gt; <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
		</CODE>
		<P>You may remember from&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_dotnet_language/20_language/30_inheritance.html">Inheritance</A>
			that if we make instances of a class comparable with each other, then we make
			the class inherit from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN> and effect the feature "&lt;".
		</P>
		<P>Here, constrained genericity does two things for us.</P>
		<UL>
				<LI><P>First,&nbsp;it states that any candidate for substitution for <SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN> must conform to
				class <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN>. Typically this means it must inherit from <SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN>.</P>
			<P><LI>Second, it allows, within the features of <SPAN CLASS="eclass">SORTED_LIST</SPAN>, the features of
				<SPAN CLASS="eclass">COMPARABLE</SPAN> to be applied to any item which&nbsp;has a type&nbsp;of <SPAN CLASS="egeneric">G</SPAN>.</P>
