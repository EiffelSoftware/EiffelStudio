After initial compilation, a boolean variable referenced in the
expression of a conditional is changed to an integer constant.  The
compiler detects the VWBE violation.  But when the declaration is
moved to a parent class, the compiler accepts the classes even though
the VWBE violation is still present.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
