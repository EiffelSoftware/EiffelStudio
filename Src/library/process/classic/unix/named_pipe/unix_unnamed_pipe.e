	description: "[
		Ojbect that manipulates a UNIX unnamed pipe.
		All the read_xxx features except read_stream_non_block in this class are block features. 
		In other words, they will block until requested number of bytes have been read.
		While read_stream_non_block will read as much as requested bytes of data and will return with
		acturally read data if no other data is in the pipe.
		All the put_xxx features are block features.
		Note: Always check last_read_successful after a read_xxx feature and check last_write_successful
				   after a write_xxx feature.
