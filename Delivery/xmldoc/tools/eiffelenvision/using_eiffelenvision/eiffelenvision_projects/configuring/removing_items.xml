			Removal of project items is heavily context based, and depends on the item you are trying to remove. To remove a project item, from an EiffelEnvision project:
			<list ordered="true">
				<item>Select the project item(s) you would like to remove.</item>
				<item>Select <bold>Edit</bold>, <bold>Delete</bold> (or <bold>Remove</bold>) from the main menu. You may also use the default DEL shortcut key.
					<note>
						<bold>Note</bold>: <bold>Delete</bold> and <bold>Remove</bold> are shown respective to a project item's ability to be removed or delete from a project (See below.)
					</note>
				</item>
				<item>For items being remove only, these items will be removed from the project.</item>
				<item>For items that can be removed or deleted, The Remove or Delete dialog box will appear. Choose <bold>Remove</bold> to remove the item only, <bold>Delete</bold> to remove and delete the item from disk.</item>
				<item>For items that can only be deleted, a confirmation dialog will appear asking you to confirm deletion. <bold>Ok</bold> will remove and delete the item, <bold>Cancel</bold> will abort the delete action and nothing will change.</item>

			EiffelEnvision projects items have three modes of removal, based on where the item is and what kind of item it is:
			<list ordered="false">
				<item>Remove Only</item>
				<item>Delete and Remove</item>
				<item>Remove or Delete</item>
			</list>

			<bold>Remove Only</bold>
			<line_break/>
			Remove only operations will only remove the select project item(s) from the <link><url>../index.xml</url><label>Project</label></link>. If the item is associated with a file, on disk, the representation on disk <bold>will not be</bold> deleted. Remove only is applicable to references under the <link><url>../structure/references/references_folder.xml</url><label>References</label></link>, files and folders found under the <link><url>../structure/other_project_items/other_project_items.xml</url><label>Other Project Items</label></link> section of an EiffelEnvision project, as well as to any <link><url>../structure/project_items/clusters_and_items/explicit_clusters.xml</url><label>Cluster</label></link> under the <link><url>../structure/project_items/project_items.xml</url><label>Project Items</label></link> or <link><url>../structure/eiffel_libraries/eiffel_libraries.xml</url><label>Eiffel Libraries</label></link> nodes.
		</paragraph>
		
		<anchor>delete_only</anchor>
		<paragraph>
			<bold>Delete Only</bold>
			<line_break/>
			Delete only operations can only be performed on EiffelEnvision project items, such as <link><url>../structure/project_items/clusters_and_items/items/file_items.xml</url><label>files</label></link> or <link><url>../structure/project_items/clusters_and_items/cluster_folders.xml</url><label>folders</label></link>, that directly map to an element on disk, and have been included in the project 
			<link><url>../structure/project_items/clusters_and_items/cluster_enumeration.xml</url><label>automatically</label></link> when the project is loaded. Delete only will remove both the file or folder on disk and subsequently remove the item from the project. The only items that have forced deletion are Eiffel source files (*.e) and folders located under the <link><url>../structure/project_items/project_items.xml</url><label>Project Items</label></link> or <link><url>../structure/eiffel_libraries/eiffel_libraries.xml</url><label>Eiffel Libraries</label></link> nodes, or any of their subnodes.

		<anchor>remove_or_delete</anchor>
		<paragraph>
			<bold>Remove or Delete</bold>
			<line_break/>
			Remove or delete is available on project file items that have been explicitly added to the project, and represent a file on disk. In EiffelEnvision projects, this type of item are all items under the <link><url>../structure/project_items/project_items.xml</url><label>Project Items</label></link> node that are not Eiffel source file (*.e). When selecting <bold>Remove</bold> from the <bold>Edit</bold> menu, a Remove or Delete dialog box will appear. Choosing <bold>Remove</bold> will only remove the item from the project. Choosing <bold>Delete</bold> will delete the item from disk and subsequently remove the item from the project.

			Remove and/or Delete may not be the operation you are after if you merely want to exclude Eiffel source file (*.e) from a <link><url>../../compiling_projects/index.xml</url><label>Build</label></link>. For information on how to exclude and include items from a build, see <link><url>item_exclusion.xml</url><label>Including and Excluding Items</label></link>.
