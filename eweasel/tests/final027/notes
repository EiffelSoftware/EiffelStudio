A class creates a LINKED_LIST [FOO] where FOO is an expanded class and
appends two elements to it and then prints the `value' attribute of
the first item in the list.  The wrong result is printed if the system
is finalized with inlining (47.250000007042502 instead of 47.25).

Discovered in release 5.6.0410.
