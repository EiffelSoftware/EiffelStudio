A class inherits an external routine and tries to redefine it, but
includes some locals in the redefined external routine.  The compiler
catches the VRRR(2) error.  Then the parent version is changed to a
deferred feature and the child version is changed to a non-external
routine.  When compilation is resumed, the compiler terminates
silently after pass 2 on the parent class.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
