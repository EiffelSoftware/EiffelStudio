        <p>Multithreaded applications provide a flexible, exciting way of
        utilizing the power of modern computer systems. ISE Eiffel supports a
        powerful multithreaded model, fast and easy to use.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <a HREF="10_thread_library.html">EiffelThread library</a>
        is mapped to the C thread standard libraries: it supports
        Windows, POSIX-like and Unix International Threads. EiffelThread is
        supported by the ISE compiler and run-time on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD,
        LinuxPPC, Solaris, SGI, VxWorks, LynxOS, CRAY and Unixware.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This document will explain <A HREF="10_thread_library.html">how to use the EiffelThread library</A>.
        To fully take advantage of this documentation you should know some
        basics about multithreaded systems</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To enable multithreading in the ISE EiffelStudio environment, you
        will need to do some changes in your <a href="../../../tools/eiffelstudio/reference/30_compiler/40_advanced_topics/30_multithreaded_applications/10_compilation.html">project
        settings</a>. To learn more about once feature in an Eiffel
        multithreaded environment, click <a href="../../../tools/eiffelstudio/reference/30_compiler/40_advanced_topics/30_multithreaded_applications/20_once_features.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Users of the EiffelThread library in version 4.5 and older should
        read &quot;<a href="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/30_compiler/40_advanced_topics/30_multithreaded_applications/30_changes_between_45_and_50.html">changes
        between 4.5 and 5.0</a>&quot; to get the info they need to migrate their
        code to the new implementation of threads in Eiffel.<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you encounter problems, take a look at the <A HREF="20_faq.html">FAQ list</A>.</p>
