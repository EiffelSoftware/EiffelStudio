Installation 

1. Make sure the environment variables ISE_EIFFEL and ISE_PLATFORM are set.

2. Configure your setup for the database

3. Install the C-libraries:

	Start your databases kernels if needed (most of the C-libraries are based
	on DBMS libraries, but some of them use a precompiler which needs to access
	the database kernel).

	Go in the directory specific to the handle you are using and perform the
	following actions. For instance, for the ODBC handle:

	* Windows:
		cd %ISE_EIFFEL%\library\store\dbms\rdbms\odbc\Clib

	 with the Borland C compiler:
	 	make_bcb.bat

	 with the Microsoft C compiler:
	 	make_msc.bat

	* Unix:
		cd $ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/dbms/rdbms/odbc/Clib
		finish_freezing -library
