test_name 	 generic-attr-call-bad-type
test_description An attribute `weasel' of a class has the type of the formal generic parameter, which is constrained by `LINKED_LIST [STRING]'.  The expression `weasel.i_th (1)' should therefore be of type STRING.  But an assignment to a local of type STRING is rejected as a VJAR error. The compiler seems to think the expression is of type `Generic #1'.
