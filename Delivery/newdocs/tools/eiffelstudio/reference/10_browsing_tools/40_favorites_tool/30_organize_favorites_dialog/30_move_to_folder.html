<h1>Move to Folder command</h1>
<p>The Move to Folder command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/browsing_tools/favorites_dialog_move_to.png" width="120" height="23">, located in
the <A HREF="00_introduction.html">Organize Favorites dialog</a>, makes it possible to move favorite items (classes
and folders) to specific folders. It is enabled only when an item is selected in
the left-hand tree in this dialog. The selected item is the item that should be
moved, the source. You can select a different source item by clicking it in the
tree, or by using the keyboard.</p>
<p>When pressed, a dialog is popped up, that prompts for the favorite folder the
selected item should be moved to.</p>
<p align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/dialogs_and_wizards/favorites_choose_folder_dialog.png"></p>
<p>Select the destination folder by expanding the tree and by clicking it. The
top tree item, named Favorites, represents the root of the favorites.</p>

<p>Pressing <b>OK </b>moves the source item to the destination folder. Pressing <b>Cancel</b>
discards the dialog box and does not move the source item.</p>

<p class="tip"><b>Tip</b>: You can also move items around by picking them in the favorites tree and dropping them where you want.</p>
