<h1>Evaluation tool</h1>
<p>The expression evaluation tool's main part is the list of expressions that
should be evaluated.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/images/eiffelstudio/debugger/expression_evaluation_tool.png"></img></p>
<p>Its first column gives the context in which the <a href="20_new_expression_dialog.html">expression</a> is evaluated.
Its second column gives the expression itself, as it was entered by the user.
The last column gives the result of the expression.</p>

<p class="tip"><b>Tip</b>: If the expression returns a non-Void object, then the
corresponding row in the list is pickable, and can be dropped for example in the
object tool to inspect its state.</p>

<p>On top of the list, three buttons can be found.

</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_expression_color.gif"> pops up the
<a href="20_new_expression_dialog.html">expression definition dialog</a>, and
can be used to define new expressions.</li>
  <li>
<img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_edit_expression_color.gif"> edits a currently
    selected expression (it is not possible to change the context of an
    expression, only the expression itself).<br>
    The associated key shortcut is F2.</li>
  <li>
<img src="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_delete_very_small_color.gif"> removes the
    selected expressions from the list.<br>
    The associated key shortcut is Del.</li>
</ul>

<p class="tip"><b>Tip</b>: Dropping an object onto this list lets you define
quickly an expression whose context is the dropped object. This avoids having to
type object addresses manually.</p>
