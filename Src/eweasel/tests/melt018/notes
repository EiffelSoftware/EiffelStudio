A class declares a local entity of an expanded type and then calls a
feature on the entity, passing the local itself as an actual argument
in the call.  The called feature evaluates `arg = Current'.  When the
system is executed, it dies with a run-time panic and the message
"operational stack botched", but only if the system is melted.  Frozen
code works fine.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
