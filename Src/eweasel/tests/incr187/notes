A system has a cluster "base", whose path name contains and
environment variable enclosed in braces, and a subcluster of "base".
After initial compilation, the date of modification of the Ace file is
changed without changing the file's contents.  When the system is
recompiled, the compiler reports a bogus VD01 error.

Reported by Manu on release 5.1.12.
