test_name 	 constant-variable-constant
test_description A system creates an instance of a class and prints the value of its only feature, which is a constant INTEGER attribute.  After initial compilation, the constant is changed to an INTEGER variable.  System execution still produces the correct result.  Then the feature is changed back to an INTEGER constant and changes are melted.  System execution then dies with a segmentation violation.
