<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>All development windows are composed of two major components, each of which
can be centered on a given &quot;address&quot; (either a cluster, a class or a
feature). One is the editor, with which go all the peripheral tools (including the
<A HREF="../20_cluster_tool/00_introduction.html">cluster tool</a> and the
<A HREF="../30_feature_tool/00_introduction.html">feature tool</a>). The other
is the context tool, which contains for example the <A HREF="../../80_formatters/00_introduction.html">formatters</A>, the 
<A HREF="../../50_diagram_tool/00_introduction.html">diagram tool</A> and the 
<A HREF="../../60_metric_tool/00_introduction.html">metric tool</A>.<p>It is possible to
either group both components so that they share the same address (allowing to
immediately
have extended information on the class that is being edited), or to separate them (allowing to have
extended information on any class while editing a class).<p>When both are grouped, only
the <A HREF="10_main_address_bar.html">main toolbar</a>  appears, whereas when they are
separated, the <A HREF="20_context_tool_address_bar.html">context tool
address bar</a> is also displayed, since it might point to a different location
than the main toolbar.<p>The <A HREF="30_switch_data_share_mode.html">toggle data mode command</a>
allows you to switch between both modes.
