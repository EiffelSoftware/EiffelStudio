A routine with an insufficiently exported entity in a precondition
violates VAPE, but the compiler accepts it.  It appears that the
compiler accepts any case where both the routine with the precondition
and the entity referenced in the precondition have an export
restriction and the entity is not completely secret.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
