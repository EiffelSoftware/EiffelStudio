A system with two classes is compiled.  Both classes are in the same
cluster and the Ace file uses "all" to include all classes in the
entire directory tree.  Then a new sub-directory is created and a
class with the same name is added to it.  When the system is
recompiled, the compiler does not detect the VSCN error.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
