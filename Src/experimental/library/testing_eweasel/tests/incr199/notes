After initial compilation where the system is finalized, a creation
procedure is changed to take an argument, introducing a VUAR error.
When the system is re-finalized, the compiler detects the error.  Then
the error is removed and compilation completes successfully, but the
generated C code won't compile, due to conflicting declarations for
the creation procedure's routine.

Discovered in Release 5.4.0403.
