A routine creates a local of type ` LINKED_LIST [like arg]', where
`arg' is the routine's formal argument and prints its generating type.
Two consecutive calls to the routine with actual arguments of type
STRING and ARRAY [STRING] produces wrong results if system is frozen
or finalized.  Melted code works correctly.
