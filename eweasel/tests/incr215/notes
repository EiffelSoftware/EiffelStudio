After initial freezing of a generic class FOO whose formal generic
parameter is constrained by DOUBLE, the constraint is changed to TEST2
with a generic creation procedure `default_create' and all references
to FOO [DOUBLE] are removed.  When the system is refrozen, the C code
won't compile.

Discovered in release 5.4.0610.
