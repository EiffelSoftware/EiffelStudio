        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Before making C++ calls in EiffelStudio, you may want to learn the
        basics of making <a href="10_c_externals.html">C calls</a>, since these basics are not repeated here but
        they might be useful for C++ users as well and are necessary to fully
        benefit from this document.
        <p>The C++ interface and Legacy++ are part of all versions of ISE Eiffel
        starting with version 4.1.</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Eiffel software must interact with software written in other
        languages. In this document you will learn about how to incorporate C++
        classes in your Eiffel software.
        <p>The C++/Eiffel interface offers the following mechanisms:
        <ul>
          <li>You can create instances of C++ classes from Eiffel, using the C++
            &quot;constructor&quot; of your choice.
          <li>You can apply to these objects all the corresponding operations
            from the C++ class: executing functions (&quot;methods&quot;),
            accessing data members, executing destructors.
          <li>You can use the Legacy++ tool to produce an Eiffel &quot;wrapper
            class&quot; encapsulating all the features of a C++ class, so that
            the result will look to the rest of the Eiffel software as if it had
            been written in Eiffel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The discussion concentrates on using C++ software from Eiffel. In the
        other direction, you can use the
        Cecil library (C-Eiffel Call-In Library) described in chapter 24 of <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/eiffel/books.html"><i>Eiffel:
        The Language</i></a> with important complements in the <a href="../40_advanced_topics/40_cecil_library/index.html">Cecil manual</a> and at ftp://ftp.eiffel.com.
        <h2>Syntax specification</h2>
        <p>In the following specification, the syntax for <font color="#aa00ff">External</font>
        and <font color="#aa00ff">External_name</font> is retained unchanged
        from <i>Eiffel: The Language</i>, where <font color="#aa00ff">Language_name</font>
        is defined simply as <font color="#aa00ff">Manifest_string</font>; the
        rest covers the additional facilities.<font color="#aa00ff">
        <pre>    External == external Language_name [External_name]

    Language_name ==
            '&quot;'
            Basic_language_name
            [Special_external_declaration]

    Basic_language_name == &quot;C&quot; | &quot;C++&quot;

    Special_external_declaration == &quot;[&quot; Special_feature &quot;]&quot;

    Special_feature == Special_C_feature | Special_C++_feature

</pre>
        </font>
        <p>As with the C extensions of the previous appendix, the syntax
        description conventions are those of <i>Eiffel: The Language</i>. <font color="#aa00ff">==</font> means
        &quot;is defined as&quot;. The vertical bar <font color="#aa00ff">|</font>
        separates alternative choices, such as the three possibilities for
        Special_feature. The brackets <font color="#aa00ff">[...]</font> enclose
        optional components; for example a <font color="#aa00ff">Language_name</font>
        is made of required quotes, a required Basic_language_name and three
        further components, any or all of which may be absent. The notation <font color="#aa00ff">{Element
        Separator ...}</font> means: 0 or more occurrences
        (&quot;specimens&quot;) of <font color="#aa00ff">Element</font>
        separated, if more than one, by <font color="#aa00ff">Separator</font>.
        <p>Several of the symbols of the syntax notation, such as the brackets
        or the vertical bar, also appear in the language; to avoid any confusion
        they are given in double quotes. For example the specification for <font color="#aa00ff">Include_files</font>
        begins with <font color="#aa00ff">&quot;|&quot;</font> to indicate that
        an <font color="#aa00ff">Include_files</font> part starts with a
        vertical bar. Single quotes may be used instead of double quotes when
        one of the quoted characters is itself a double quote; for example <font color="#aa00ff">'%&quot;'</font>
        appearing in the production for <font color="#aa00ff">User_file_name</font>
        denotes the percent character followed by the double quote character.
        Special words such as <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b> in bold
        italics stand for themselves, unquoted.
        <h2>Available possibilities</h2>
        <h3><i>Processing C++ features</i></h3>
        <p>A <font color="#aa00ff">Special_C++_feature</font>, if present,
        indicates one of the following, all illustrated by examples in the next
        sections:
        <ul>
          <li>If the special feature's declaration simply starts with a C++
            class name, followed by the associated file name, it indicates that
            the Eiffel feature will call a C++ member function (also known as a
            &quot;method&quot;) from that class. The name of the member function
            is by default the same as the name of the Eiffel feature; as usual,
            you can specify a different name through the alias clause of the
            external declaration.
          <li>If the declaration starts with <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>,
            it indicates a call to a C++ static function.
          <li>If the declaration starts with <b><font color="#000080">new</font></b>,
            it indicates a call to one of the constructors in the C++ class,
            which will create a new instance of that class and apply to it the
            corresponding constructor function.
          <li>If the declaration starts with <b><font color="#000080">delete</font></b>,
            it indicates a call to a destructor from the C++ class. In this case
            the Eiffel class may inherit <a href="/libraries/base/reference/kernel/memory.html"><span class="eclass">MEMORY</span></a> and redefine the
            dispose procedure to execute the destructor operations whenever the
            Eiffel objects are garbage-collected.
          <li>If the declaration starts with <b><font color="#000080">data_member</font></b>,
            it indicates access to a data member (attribute in Eiffel
            terminology) from the C++ class.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The rest of the possible components are the same as in the C
        interface: <font color="#aa00ff">Signature</font> to specify types for
        arguments and results; possible <font color="#aa00ff">Include</font>
        file.
        <h3><i>Extra argument</i></h3>
        <p>For a non-static C++ member function or destructor, the corresponding
        Eiffel feature should include an extra argument of type POINTER, at the
        first position. This argument represents the C++ object to which the
        function will be applied.
        <p>For example, a C++ function
        <pre>    void add(int new_int);</pre>
        <p>should have the Eiffel counterpart
        <CODE><pre>	<span class="efeature">cpp_add</span> (obj: <span class="eclass">POINTER</span>; new_int: <span class="eclass">INTEGER</span>) <span class="ekeyword">is</span>
		<span class="ecomment">-- Encapsulation of member function add.</span>
	<span class="ekeyword">external</span>
		&quot;C++ [IntArray %&quot;intarray.h%&quot;] (IntArray *, int)&quot;
	<span class="ekeyword">end</span></pre>
        </code>
        This scheme, however, is often inconvenient because it forces the Eiffel
        side to work on objects in a non-object-oriented way. (The
        object-oriented way treats the current object, within a class, as
        implicit.) A better approach, used by Legacy++, is to make a feature
        such as cpp_add secret, and to export a feature whose signature
        corresponds to that of the original C++ function, with no extra object
        argument; that feature will use a secret attribute object_ptr to access
        the object. In the example this will give the feature
        <CODE><pre>	<span class="efeature">add</span> (new_int: <span class="eclass">INTEGER</span>) <span class="ekeyword">is</span>
		<span class="ecomment">-- Encapsulation of member function add.</span>
	<span class="ekeyword">do</span>
		<span class="efeature">cpp_add</span> (object_ptr, new_int)
	<span class="ekeyword">end</span></pre>
        </code>
        <p>where <i>object_ptr</i> is a secret attribute of type <a href="/libraries/base/reference/kernel/pointer.html"><span class="eclass">POINTER</span></a>,
        initialized by the creation procedures of the class. To the Eiffel
        developer, add looks like a normal object-oriented feature, which takes
        only the expected argument. Further examples appear below. This
        technique only works of course when the C++ object is implicit in the
        context of the Eiffel class.
        <p>There is no need for an extra argument in the case of static member
        functions, constructors and data members.
        <h2>Wrapping C++ classes: Legacy++</h2>
        <p>Before taking a look at examples of the various facilities mentioned,
        it is useful to consider the tool that will help you, in many cases,
        avoid worrying about their details.
        <h3><i>The role of Legacy++</i></h3>
        <p>Often you will want to provide an Eiffel encapsulation of all the
        facilities -- member functions, static functions, constructors,
        destructors, data members -- of a C++ class. This means producing an
        Eiffel class that will provide an Eiffel feature for each one of these
        C++ facilities, using external declarations based on the mechanisms
        listed in the preceding section.
        <p>Rather than writing these external declarations and the class
        structure manually, you can use the Legacy++ tool to produce the Eiffel
        class automatically from the C++ class.
        <h3><i>Calling Legacy++</i></h3>
        <p>Legacy++ is called with an argument denoting a <i>.h</i> file that
        must contain C++ code: one or more classes and structure declarations.
        It will translate these declarations into Eiffel wrapper classes.
        Legacy++ is only available on Windows. It is located in the $ISE_EIFFEL\bench\spec\windows\bin
        directory, under the name h2e.exe. By default the installation program
        creates an entry for it in the Start menu.
        <p>The following options are available:
        <ul>
          <li><b>-E</b>: apply the C preprocessor to the file, so that it will
            process #include, #define, #ifdef and other preprocessor directives.
            This is in fact the default, so that you do not need to specify -E
            explicitly (see next option).
          <li><b>-NE</b>: do not apply the C preprocessor to the file.
          <li><b>-p </b><i>directories</i>: use <i>directories</i> as include
            path.
          <li><b>-c</b><i>compiler</i>: use <i>compiler</i> as the C++ compiler.
          <li><b>-g</b>: treat the C++ code as being intended for the GNU C++
            compiler.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Result of applying Legacy++</i></h3>
        <p>Running Legacy++ on a C++ file will produce the corresponding Eiffel
        classes. Legacy++ processes not only C++ classes but also C++ &quot;structs&quot;;
        in both cases it will generate an Eiffel class.
        <p>Legacy++ knows about default specifiers: public for structs, private
        for classes.
        <p>Legacy++ will generate Eiffel features for member functions (static
        or not).
        <p>It will also handle any constructors and destructors given in the C++
        code, yielding the corresponding Eiffel creation procedures. If there is
        no explicit constructor, it will produce a creation procedure with no arguments
        and an empty body.
        <p>For any non-static member function or destructor, Legacy++ will
        generate a secret feature with an extra argument representing the
        object, as explained in the preceding section in this page. It will
        also produce a public feature with the same number of arguments as the
        C++ function, relying on a call to the secret feature, as illustrated
        for add and cpp_add above.
        <p>The char* type is translated into <a href="/libraries/base/reference/kernel/pointer.html"><span class="eclass">STRING</span></a>. Pointer types, as
        well as reference types corresponding to classes and types that Legacy++
        has processed, will be translated into <a href="/libraries/base/reference/kernel/pointer.html"><span class="eclass">POINTER</span></a>. Other types will
        yield the type <span class="eclass">UNRESOLVED_TYPE</span>.
        <h3><i>Legacy++ limitations</i></h3>
        <p>It is up to you to supply Eiffel equivalents of all the needed types.
        If Legacy++ encounters the name of a C++ class or type that is does not
        know -- i.e. it is neither a predefined type nor a previously translated
        class -- it will use the Eiffel type name <span class="eclass">UNRESOLVED_TYPE</span>. If you
        do not change that type in the generated class, the Eiffel compiler will
        produce an error (unknown class) at degree 5.
        <p>Legacy++ does not handle inline function declarations.
        <p>Legacy++ makes no effort to understand the C++ inheritance structure.
        <p>More generally, given the differences in the semantic models of C++
        and Eiffel, Legacy++ can only perform the basic Eiffel wrapping of a C++
        class, rather than a full translation. You should always inspect the
        result and be prepared to adapt it manually.
        <p>Legacy++'s contribution is to take care of the bulk of the work, in
        particular the tedious and repetitive parts. The final details are left
        to the Eiffel software developer.
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Consider the following C++ class, which has an example of every kind
        of facility that one may wish to access from the Eiffel side:
        <pre>    class IntArray
            {
            public:
                IntArray(int size);
                ~IntArray();
                void output();
                void add(int new_int);
                static char * type();

            protected:
                int *_integers;
            };
</pre>
        <p>Here is the result of applying Legacy++ to that class, which will
        serve as an illustration of both the C++ interface mechanisms and
        Legacy++:
