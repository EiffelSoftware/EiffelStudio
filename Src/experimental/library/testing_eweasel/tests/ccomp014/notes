A class calls a function whose return type is an expanded type.  The
expanded class on which the expanded type is based has a creation
procedure.  If the system is finalized with dead code removal on, the
generated C code will compile but won't link.  This appears to be a
dead code removal problem.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
