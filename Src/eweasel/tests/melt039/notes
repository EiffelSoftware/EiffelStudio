A generic class with formal generic parameter `G' has a routine `foo'
with a local entity of type `G'.  The body of the routine calls
`generator' on this local.  Another class inherits from the generic
class and provides an expanded type as actual generic parameter.  When
the system is executed, it correctly prints the local's generating
class, but then dies with a panic if the system was melted.  Frozen
code works fine.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
