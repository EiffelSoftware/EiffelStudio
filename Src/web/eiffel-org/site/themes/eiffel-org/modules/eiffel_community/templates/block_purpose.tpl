<p>Eiffel.org a forum that brings together Eiffel developers around the world
to build libraries, share experiences, and help each other on all matters
related to open-source Eiffel.</p>

<p>The site's mission is to provide all programmers convinced that Eiffel makes
the programming world a better place with the necessary resources for the
betterment of its cause.</p>

<p>Eiffel.org is independent from any organization, commercial entity, or
single person. The site is owned by the Eiffel Community and its members. A
handful of volunteers from the community (known as the review board) serve
to administer and manage content throughout the site.</p>
