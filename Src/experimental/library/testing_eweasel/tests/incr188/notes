A system creates an instance of a class and prints the value of its
only feature, which is a constant INTEGER attribute.  After initial
compilation, the constant is changed to an INTEGER variable.  System
execution still produces the correct result.  Then the feature is
changed back to an INTEGER constant and changes are melted.  System
execution then dies with a segmentation violation.

Discovered in release 5.1.12.
