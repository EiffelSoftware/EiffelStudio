A class inherits twice from the same parent and renames the single
inherited feature, thereby replicating it.  But when an heir of this
class tries to give these two feature the same name by renaming one of
them (sharing under repeated inheritance) the compiler reports a VMFN
error.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
