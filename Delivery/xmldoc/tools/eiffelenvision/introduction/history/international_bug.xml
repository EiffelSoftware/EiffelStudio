		The problem lies in the registration of <italic>msenvp.dll</italic>, located in your Windows XP installation 
		<bold>Common Files</bold> folder. On English versions of Windows XP this folder is located,
		typically, in '<code>C:\Program Files\Common Files</code>'. On the other hand, the French version of Windows 
		XP is located typically in '<code>C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs</code>', and it is this translation that the Visual
		Studio .NET 2003 installation does not account for.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
		To correct this issue you will need to reregister <italic>msenvp.dll</italic> manually. To
		do this open a command line console. This can be done using the <bold>Start Menu</bold> &gt;  
		<bold>Run</bold> (or use Ctrl+R), and typing
		</paragraph>
		<code_block>cmd.exe</code_block>
		<paragraph>
		in the field provided and clicking <bold>Ok</bold>.
		</paragraph>
		
		<paragraph>
		From the command-line console navigate to your Windows XP <bold>Common Files</bold> folder
		, which should be a direct translation of Common Files in your chosen installation language. 
		For the French edition of Windows XP your would navigate type the following into the command-line  
		console and press Enter.
		</paragraph>
		<code_block>cd "C:\Program Files\Fichiers communs"</code_block>
		<paragraph>
		Now continue navigating to the 'Microsoft Shared\MSEnv' sub-folder.
		</paragraph>
		<code_block>cd "Microsoft Shared\MSEnv"</code_block>
		<paragraph>
		Located in the current folder should now be a file call <italic>msenvp.dll</italic>. You 
		can confirm this by typing the 'dir' command followed by pressing Enter.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
		To register the DLL you will need to use the <italic>regsvr32.exe</italic> Windows registration tool.
		Type the following into the console an press Enter.
		</paragraph>
		<code_block>regsvr32 msenvp.dll</code_block>
		<paragraph>
		If registration succeeded you will be presented with a Windows information dialog box confirming 
		the success of the registration. Discard the dialog by clicking <bold>Ok</bold>. You will now be able to use  
		EiffelEnvision successfully from within Visual Studio .NET 2003.
