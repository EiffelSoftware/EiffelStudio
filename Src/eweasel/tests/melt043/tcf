test_name 	expanded-creation-alloc-memory
test_description A class repeatedly creates an instance of another class which has one attribute of an expanded type.  The base class of the expanded type has a creation procedure which allocates a small amount of memory to initialize the value of a string attribute.  If the system is melted, a segmentation fault occurs when the system is executed.  Frozen code works fine.
