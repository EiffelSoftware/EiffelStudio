			-- item cell is being drawn which does not contain an item.

			-- This is useful for drawing additional border styles or other such effects. The upper left corner
			-- of the item cell starts at coordinates 0x0 in the passed drawable. All drawing Performed
			-- in the drawable is clipped to `width' of the column at `a_column_index' and `height' of row at `a_row_index'.

			-- Actions to be performed when part of the background area of the grid that is outside of the
			-- area filled by `row_count' and `column_count' needs to be redrawn.
			-- By default, the grid fills the area in its `background_color'. If one or more agents are
			-- contained in this action sequence, the grid is no longer responsible for drawing its background
			-- and the agents must redraw this area, otherwise graphical glitches may appear.
			-- The five pieces of event data passed are:
			-- drawable: EV_DRAWABLE The drawable into which you must draw the background.
			-- virtual_x: INTEGER The virtual x position of the area to be redrawn.
			-- virtual_y: INTEGER The virtual y position of the area to be redrawn.
			-- width: INTEGER The width of the area that must be redrawn.
			-- height: INTEGER The height of the area that must be redrawn.
			-- The upper left corner of the drawing must start at 0x0 in `drawable' with an area given by `width'
			-- and `height'. The virtual coordinates specify the position of the area in relation to the grid's
			-- virtual positiion which is essential if you wish to draw something such as a texture which must be
			-- matched based on its position.
			-- Note that `fill_background_actions' may be fired multiple times to fill the complete area of the
			-- background that is invalid.

			Result := implementation.fill_background_actions
		ensure
			not_void: Result /= Void
