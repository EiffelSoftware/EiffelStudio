        <p>This document provides an overview of the C-Eiffel Call-In Library
        (CECIL) as defined in Eiffel: The Language (ETL). The first section
        adresses how to compile and run a CECIL program, on the
        <A HREF="10_compiling_a_system_for_cecil.html">Eiffel side</A> and
        on the <A HREF="20_c_side_compilation.html">C side</A>. The <A HREF="30_cecil_interface.html">second part</A>
        contains a more precise description of the Eiffel types, the protection
        mechanism as well as how to write and use C externals.
        <p>CECIL, designed by ISE, is the C library that permits C and C++
        applications (as well as applications written in other languages) to
        take advantage of almost all Eiffel facilities: create Eiffel objects,
        apply features to them. The basics of CECIL are described in chapter 24
        of the reference book on Eiffel, Eiffel: The Language, which covers
        interfaces between Eiffel and other languages. Important material can
        also be found in the ISE manual Eiffel: The Environment.
        <p>The CECIL documentation, man pages and examples are part of the
        standard delivery with the ISE Compiler 4.5 and higher.
        <p>The present document complements the descriptions of Eiffel: The
        Language. Note that CECIL has been revised and improved since that book
        was published, so the explanations below have precedence over those in the book.
        <p>This document is intended for both Windows and Unix users. Only a few
        of the sections, clearly marked, are platform-specific.</p>
        To access Eiffel mechanisms from C or other external languages:
        <ul>
          <li>Compile your Eiffel system so as to generate &quot;Cecilized&quot;
            code, that is to say code callable from the outside. See <a href="10_compiling_a_system_for_cecil.html">Compiling
            your Eiffel system for CECIL</a>.
          <li>In writing the external code that will use the facilities of the
            Eiffel system, use the CECIL functions as specified in chapter 24 of
            <i>Eiffel: The Language</i>. See also <a href="30_cecil_interface.html">The CECIL
            interface overview</a>.
          <li>C-compile and link that code. See <a href="20_c_side_compilation.html">Building
            a C system using CECIL</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For feature by feature specification, please have a look at <a href="man_pages/index.html">the
        man pages</a>.</p>
