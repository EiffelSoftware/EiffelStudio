<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The favorites tool ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_favorites_color.gif"> ) gives a quick access to often used classes. These may be
either classes of a library or classes that are often being modified. They are
project-wide, which means they are shared by all development windows working on
the same project.</p>
<p>SCREENSHOT(favorites tool)</p>
<p>The favorites tool mainly consists in a left-panel tool, giving a <A HREF="10_favorites_tree.html">tree
representation</a> of the favorite classes, and in the <A HREF="20_favorites_menu.html">favorites menu</a>.</p>
