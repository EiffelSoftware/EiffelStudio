A class A declares an entity of type `expanded B [like Current]'.
Since B inherits from A, there should be an expanded client cycle
involving only B.  But the compiler does not detect the VLEC error.
If the entity type is instead `expanded B [A]' the VLEC error is
detected.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
