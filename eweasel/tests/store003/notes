A class creates an instance of a second class, stores it in a file
using `independent_store' and then opens the file and retrieves what
was previously stored.  After initial compilation, system execution
works correctly.  Then an instruction is added to a routine and
changes are melted.  Execution then incorrectly ends with a mismatch
retrieval error.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
