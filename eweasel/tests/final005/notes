Finalizing a particular system with a function call whose argument is
a manifest array produces C code which compiles fine.  But when the
system is executed, a segmentation fault occurs.  If the system is
instead melted or frozen, system execution works as expected.  This
appears to be a code generator problem.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
