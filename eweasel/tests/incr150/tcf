test_name 	 add-remove-veen-freeze
test_description After initial compilation, a VEEN error is introduced by changing an identifier in a class invariant.  When the compiler detects it, the error is removed and compilation resumes and finishes normally.  But a subsequent attempt to freeze the system with no further changes causes the compiler to die.
