An internal routine A with no rescue clause calls a second internal
routine B, passing it some feature addresses.  Routine B raises an
exception.  After initial compilation where the system is frozen, the
routine B is modified to cause it to be melted.  When routine A is
called repeatedly, more and more C memory is used, which seems to
indicate a memory leak.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
