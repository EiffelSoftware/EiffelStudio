A class calls a recursive routine which creates 255 strings, all
fairly short.  If the depth of recursion is 22 or greater, a run-time
panic occurs when the system is executed.  If the routine only creates
200 strings, then the system executes correctly up to a recursion
depth of at least 1000.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
