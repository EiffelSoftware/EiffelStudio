		<H1>What's new in EiffelStudio 5.2</H1>
		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Added a status bar, which gives a lot of information, such as the
            state of the compilation or the name of the current project.</li>
          <li>Clicking feature clauses in the feature tree now centers the
            editor on the selected feature clause.</li>
          <li>More specific icons in the feature and cluster trees, so that
            identifying deferred classes and the nature of features is now
            straightforward.</li>
          <li>Up to 10 
          <a href="../70_wizards_and_dialogs/30_dialogs/30_external_commands/00_introduction.html">external commands</a> can now be defined and called from the <b>Tools</b>
            menu.</li>
          <li>The new <b>Quick compile</b> command lets you recompile only the
            classes that have been edited in EiffelStudio, skipping the
            sometimes tedious degree 6, that looks for modified classes.</li>
          <li>Control picking now has a configurable effect.</li>
          <li>More improvements in usability and bug fixes.</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Compiler</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click
          <a href="../30_compiler/60_version_history/02_52_release/00_51_to_52_changes.html">here</a> for more details on compiler improvements and full Eiffel 
          support on .NET</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Debugger</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Right-clicking on one of the run buttons will popup a dialog 
          enabling you to choose the command line argument (it is a shortcut for 
          `Project Settings'-&gt;Debug tab).</li>
          <li>Expressions can now be dynamically evaluated in the debugger. (<a href="../40_debugger/50_expression_evaluation/index.html">info</a>)</li>
          <li>Conditional breakpoints. (<a href="../40_debugger/20_breakpoints/index.html">info</a>)</li>
          <li>Classes can now define <span  class="efeature">debug_output</span> a feature inherited from 
          <span  class="eclass">DEBUG_OUTPUT</span>, whose string result is automatically displayed in the 
          debugger for all objects of that type. (<a href="../40_debugger/40_object_tool/17_debug_output.html">info</a>)</li>
          <li>Possible stack overflows can now be detected in the debugger
            before they occur. (<a href="../40_debugger/60_stack_overflow_prevention.html">info</a>)</li>
        </ul>

          	<li>Changed signature of <span  class="efeature">out</span> and <span  class="efeature">replace_substring</span>

          	<li>Added <span  class="efeature">keep_tail</span>, <span  class="efeature">keep_head</span>, <span  class="efeature">remove_tail</span>, <span  class="efeature">remove_head</span> and make

        <h3>EiffelTime</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rewritten so that no additional C libraries is 
          needed. Therefore you have to update your project configuration files 
          to reflect this change, i.e. removing the include directory and the 
          object file of the old EiffelTime library.</li>
        </ul>

          which were affecting EiffelBuild.</li>
          <li>Fixed incorrect Ace file specification for EiffelVision2 examples 
          and wizards on Unix platforms where application could be linked 
          dynamically with `libpng' but should not.</li>
          <li>Fixed EiffelStore handle for Oracle so that it works fine when 
          compiled with the Borland C compiler.</li>

<span class="ekeyword">end</span></pre>
          <li>Fixed incorrect C file naming when generating a .NET system that
