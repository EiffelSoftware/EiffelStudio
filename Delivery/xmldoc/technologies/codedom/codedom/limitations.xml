		The current implementation of the Eiffel CodeDom Provider does not support parsing Eiffel source code 
		to produce a CodeDom tree. Only code generation and compilation are supported in the current release.

		</heading>

		Only managed code can be generated or compiled by the Eiffel CodeDom Provider. This means that the 
		CodeDom tree being compiled cannot include snippet members which use or define Eiffel external clauses. 
		If the system requires access to external methods, they should be defined in a precompiled library (see 
		<link><label>Configuration</label><url>configuration.xml</url></link>).
