A generic derivation of a class with a constrained formal generic
parameter (using `like Current' as actual generic parameter) is
rejected as violating validity constraint VE04, but only when used as
a type in an inheritance clause.  Hitting return to retry compilation
with no change causes an exception trace.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
