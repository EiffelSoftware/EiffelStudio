Installation instructions:

1. Use tar to get the eweasel directory tree off the tape.

2. Modify files in the `control' subdirectory so that they are
   appropriate for your site.  I believe you will only have to modify
   file `site_specific'.

3. Note: version 0.2 of `eweasel' is not compatible with version 0.1.
   Some of the test control files have changed a little bit.  You
   should therefore completely replace the previous distribution
   (version 0.1) with this distribution.
