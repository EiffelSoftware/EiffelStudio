<h1>Window related commands</h1>
<p>A few commands give the possibility to manage the development windows
globally. They are located both in the <A HREF="20_window_menu.html"><b>Window menu</b></a>
and in the main toolbar.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<b>New window</b>: this command ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_new_development_tool_color.gif"> ) creates a new empty development
window. Note that it is also possible to
<A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/05_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">drop</a>
a class or a feature on it to
create a development window that is immediately centered on the dropped item.
	<li>
    <b>Minimize all</b>: this command ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_minimize_all_color.gif"> ) iconifies all development
    windows.
	<li>
    <b>Raise all</b>: this command ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_restore_all_color.gif"> ) raises all minimized development
    windows.
	<li>
    <b>Raise unsaved windows</b>: this command raises all the
    development windows that have not been saved. It may be combined with the <b>Minimize
    all</b> command to find easily which development windows need to be saved.
</ul>
