The EiffelStore library provides a consistent set of 
classes for writing object oriented Eiffel applications that need 
to handle persistent objects.

The library interface consists of two sets:

1) A set of general purpose classes designed regardless of any data 
 management system used, to be found in directory 
 $ISE_LIBRARY/library/store/interface, and that you always need in your universe

2) Specific classes, referred to by the interface classes, bridging
  the application to selected data management systems called ``handles''. 
  The set of handles may be found:

   * in directory $ISE_LIBRARY/library/store/dbms

   * in the directory $ISE_LIBRARY/library/store/dbms/rdbms/{server_name}   
   with {server_name} corresponding to a selected relational database 
   management system.

   The best way to use them is to include the corresponding configuration file
   $ISE_LIBRARY/library/store/dbms/rdbms/{server_name}/{server_name.ecf}

   Additional support classes are also needed in your universe
   regardless of the selected handle. They are located in:
   
   * directory $ISE_LIBRARY/library/store/support and 
      $ISE_LIBRARY/library/store/dbms/support

Example classes are located in $ISE_EIFFEL/examples/store

EiffelStore has currently only been tested with:
		EiffelStudio 5.7
   		Oracle8 8.0.4
		ODBC 3.0

Documentation
-------------
   The user's manual is in Postscript format in directory /doc
   (cover page + content in US LTR format)

Then, to install EiffelStore external libraries, go to directory 
$ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/install (a README file provides full instructions).
