Error code: VTGC(3)

Error: Every feature name listed in the creators part of
  the constraint must occur in exactly one constraining
  class.
What to do: Use renaming if there are several candidates
  or make sure that the creation constraint feature really
  exists.

Class: BB [G -> {attached CC, detachable CC} create make end]
The feature `make' occurs in the following set of constraint classes:

	{attached CC}.make  from formal G at constraint position #1.
	{detachable CC}.make  from formal G at constraint position #2.
Line: 1
  ->class BB [G -> {attached CC, detachable CC} create make end]
