<h1>Feature tree</h1>
<P align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/browsing_tools/feature_tree.png"></P>
<p>The feature tree gives a summary of all the features of the currently edited
class. They are in the same order as they are in the class file, and they are
grouped by their feature clause.</p>
<p>The icon relative to the feature clause indicates the export status of the
features inside it:</p>
<ul>
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_feature_clause_any.gif"> means features are exported to all classes
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_feature_clause_some.gif"> means features are exported to
      some classes
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_feature_clause_none.gif"> means features are
      not exported
</ul>
<p>The icon on the features indicates the nature of the feature:</p>
<ul>
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_attribute_symbol.gif"> for
      attributes
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_once_symbol.gif"> for
      once and constant features
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_deferred_feature.gif"> for
      deferred features
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_external_feature.gif"> for external features
	<li><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_feature_color.gif"> for normal Eiffel routines
</ul>
<p>Clicking a feature or a feature clause in the tree centers the editor on it. Key navigation is
also available. All features can be
<A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">picked</a>,
to <A HREF="/tools/eiffelstudio/reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">drop</a>
them into any component of the interface that accepts features.</p>
