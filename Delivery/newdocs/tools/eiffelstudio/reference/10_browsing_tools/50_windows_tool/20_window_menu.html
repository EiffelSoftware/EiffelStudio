<h1>Window menu</h1>
<p>The <b>window </b>menu is divided into two parts. The first one is composed
of the <A HREF="30_window_related_commands.html">window-related commands</a>. The second one is the list of all opened
development windows. Clicking any of these raises the selected development
window, so that it becomes the top-level window.</p>
