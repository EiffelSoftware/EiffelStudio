If the compiler discovers a validity violation on the root class class
(at least in pass 3) and stops and then the name of the root class is
changed so that it is the same as the name of another class in the
cluster, an exception trace results.  It is the previously reported
`cluster_modified' assertion violation.

Fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
