A class with one attribute, which is of type LINKED_LIST [STRING],
repeatedly calls `strip ()' and checks the result.  The system
compiles fine, but executing it yields some `strip' result arrays
whose first element does not conform to LINKED_LIST [STRING].  Trying
to print the offending first element terminates system execution with
an illegal instruction.

Discovered in Release 3.3 beta.
