The EiffelStore library provides a consistent set of 
classes for writing object oriented Eiffel applications that need 
to handle persistent objects.

The library interface consists of two sets:

1) A set of general purpose classes designed regardless of any data 
 management system used, to be found in directory 
 $ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/interface, and that you always need in your universe

2) Specific classes, referred to by the interface classes, bridging
  the application to selected data management systems called ``handles''. 
  The set of handles may be found:

   * in directory $ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/dbms

   * in the directory $ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/dbms/rdbms/{server_name}   
   with {server_name} corresponding to a selected relational database 
   management system.

   Additional support classes are also needed in your universe
   regardless of the selected handle. They are located in:
   
   * directory $ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/support and 
      $ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/dbms/support
   
Example classes are located in $ISE_EIFFEL/examples/store

EiffelStore 4.5 has currently only been tested with:
		ISE-Eiffel Release 4.5
   		Oracle8 8.0.4
		Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise for Windows NT Evaluation Copy Version 11.5
		IngresII
		ODBC 3.0

Documentation
-------------
   The user's manual is in Postscript format in directory /doc
   (cover page + content in US LTR format)

Then, to install EiffelStore external libraries, go to directory 
$ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/install (a README file provides full instructions).

Then, making sure that you have the requested database (Oracle,
Sybase, etc) call: 
   make_bcc or make_msc depending on which C compiler you are using (bcc for Borland
   and msc for Microsoft).
from inside this current EiffelStore directory.

In the case of Oracle, make sure you are registered as an Oracle user.

Note
----
If you are using EiffelStore with a specific RDBMS, read carefully
the following file:
   $ISE_EIFFEL/library/store/install/{basename}.txt
