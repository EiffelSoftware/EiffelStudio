		<paragraph>In the client-server model of computing, a number of software    systems, the clients, may require general-purpose services provided by    other systems, the servers. Clients and servers run concurrently, on the    same machine or, more generally, on different machines connected through    a network.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Typically, the clients are systems, for example systems that provide    useful facilities for human users; the servers take care of operations    that clients could not perform on their own (or would perform less    efficiently), and of operations that are common to several clients.    Example of servers include:
			<list ordered="false">
				<item>
					<bold>Computation servers</bold>, which take care of heavy or      specialized computations not appropriate for the clients, assuming      the servers' processors are more powerful.
				</item>
				<item>
					<bold>File servers</bold> and 
					<bold>database servers</bold>, providing access      to persistent data that different clients may need to access.
				</item>
			</list>
			<paragraph>The client-server relation is usually many-to-many: each client     application, in the course of performing its duties, may successively     require services from different servers; and each server may cater to     different clients. This second aspect, illustrated by the following     figure, is particularly important; it allows a single server to     communicate with as many clients as appropriate.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Although communication occurs both ways - clients sending objects to    servers and conversely - the situation in such a scheme is usually not    symmetric. Whereas a client requesting a certain service will need to    know beforehand what server provides that service, the server, for its    part, will not in general name its clients in advance; it will simply    stand ready to provide its services to whatever suitable client happens    to request them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This dissymmetry appears clearly in EiffelNet and in the examples of    this manual. It means in particular that clients and servers act    differently at the 
				<bold>beginning</bold> of their client-server lifecycle.    The party that initiates the communication is the client; in this    operation it will identify the desired server (through a local file name    for communication on the same machine, or though a machine name for    network communication). The server simply makes itself ready for    possible connections by starting to "listen" on the    communication channels - relying for this on an EiffelNet procedure that    is indeed called 
				<italic>listen</italic>.
