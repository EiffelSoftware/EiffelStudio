An assignment with source type `PARENT' and target type `like Current'
is correctly allowed in a feature of the class PARENT.  But when CHILD
inherits PARENT the assignment becomes invalid since the target type
`like Current' becomes effectively CHILD, so we have PARENT assigned
to CHILD which violates the Assignment rule.  The compiler does not
detect this violation.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
