<h1>Installation instructions</h1>
<p>Before installing the .NET components for Eiffel for .NET you need to install the Visual 
Studio .NET Release Candidate and do the proper 
configuration of these tools to be run from the command line, otherwise the
installation of the .NET components will fail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Configuring your .NET installation</h2>

<p>After installing Visual Studio .NET, you should have the following 
directories:</p>
<pre>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\FrameworkSDK\bin
C:\WINNT\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.0.3328</pre>

<p>Depending on your version of the Visual Studio .NET Release Candidate you 
installed, the last element of the second directory might change. Check your 
installation for the appropriate name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to work properly, EiffelStudio for .NET needs the two above 
directories to be in your PATH environment variable. Check your Windows 
documentation on how to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once it is done, open a DOS console a ensure that the following tools are 
available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>gacutil.exe</li>
  <li>sn.exe</li>
  <li>regasm.exe</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuring Eiffel for .NET after a failed installation</h2>
<p>In the event, you installed EiffelStudio without having the proper .NET 
configuration (as described above) you can still configure the .NET components 
for Eiffel for .NET without redoing a reinstallation of EiffelStudio. To do so, 
go to the $ISE_EIFFEL directory (the install directory of ISE EiffelStudio) and 
in this directory from a DOS prompt type the following command:</p>
<pre>dotnet_install.bat</pre>
<p>After doing this, you will be able to use Eiffel for .NET from EiffelStudio.</p>
