# Eiffel Web Server Gateway Interface 

## Overview
The main goal of this library is to provide a common layer on top of many different connectors.
A connector is a library used for the integration of Eiffel web server application with an underlying httpd server technology such as CGI, libFCGI, or even standalone Eiffel Web Nino (which is a httpd server written in Eiffel).

Then one can build an Eiffel web service compliant with EWSGI specification, and thus with the same code (or almost), this could be compiled to run on any available connectors.
