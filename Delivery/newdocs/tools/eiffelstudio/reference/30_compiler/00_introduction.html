        <P>EiffelStudio naturally includes a powerful Eiffel compiler, which is
        at the core of the IDE. It supports the entire Eiffel language as
        defined in the third edition of Eiffel: The Language.</P>
        <P>This compiler uses the <A HREF="50_technology/05_melting_ice_technology.html">melting ice technology (TM)</A>, which accounts
        for lightning-fast incremental recompilations, ideal during the
        development cycle. It also provides finalization, which yields a high level
        of optimization that should be used for released programs.</P>
        <P>This reference describes some advanced functionality of the ISE
        compiler, such as <A HREF="30_external_features/index.html">making external calls from Eiffel</A>.</P>
        <P>You can find more advanced technologies relative to the ISE Eiffel compiler and environment
        in the <a href="/technologies/index.html">technologies</A> part of the documentation.</P>
