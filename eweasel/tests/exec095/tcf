test_name 	 internal-exception-memory-leak
test_description An internal routine A with no rescue clause calls a second internal routine B, passing it some feature addresses.  Routine B raises an exception.  After initial compilation where the system is frozen, the routine B is modified to cause it to be melted.  When routine A is called repeatedly, more and more C memory is used, which seems to indicate a memory leak.
