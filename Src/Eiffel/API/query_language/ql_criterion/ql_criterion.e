					Object that represents a criterion in Eiffel query lanagage
					
					Intrinsic domain
					
					A criterion can have an inclusive intrinsic domain, exclusive intrinsic domain or 
					no intrinsic domain. To understant what is an intrinsic domain, we should have a look at 
					how query language works in general.
					
					For example, query:
						select class where is_deferred
					This query will list all classes in current application target and check if a classes is deferred, 
					if it is, it will be put into result domain.
					
					And in query:
						select class where ancestor_is "STRING"
					To evaluate this query, in deed, we don't need to list all classes in current application target because, 
					the compiler can provide us the descendant information of class STRING. In this case, 
					the best way to evaluate the query is to get a list of descendant classes of class STRING first 
					from the compiler, and then check those classes to see if they are in current application target 
					(which is obviously true in our case), if so, we put them in the result domain.

					So a criterion like ancestor_is is called criterion with an intrinsic domain. Other
					intrinsic domain criterion include: descendant_is, parent_is, heir_is, caller_is,
					callers_of, implementors_of.
					And in this case, the intrinsic domain is an inclusive intrinsic domain.

					When an inclusive intrinsic domain criterion is applied to a NOT criterion, its inclusive
					intrinsic domain turns to an exclusive intrinsic domain of the not criterion.

					For example,
						select class where not ancestor_is "STRING"
					here, not ancestor_is "STRING" is a NOT criterion with an exclusive intrinsic domain.
					And this exclusive intrinsic domain is from the inclusive intrinsic domain of
					the criterion ancestor_is.

					A criterion such as is_deferred has no intrinsic domain.
					
					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------					
					
					Criterion retrieval
					
					Criterion object can be retrieved from criterion factories.
					For more information about criterion factories, see {QL_CRIERION_FACTORY} and its
					descendant classes.
