note
	description: "[
		Represents a repository containing persistent objects.
		
		A repository can be used to execute read-only queries or create
		a new transaction context for read-write operations.
		
		It is possible to change some of the default settings
		for performance tuning, such as the transaction isolation level
		or the batch size for lazy loading during query execution.
		
		The repository class provides a common interface for all ABEL
		backends. However, the creation process cannot be abstracted.
		To hide the (often quite complicated) creation process each
		backend should ship its own factory class for its repository
		implementation.
