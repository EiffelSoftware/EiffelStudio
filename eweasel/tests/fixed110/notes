A certain class causes an exception trace in the compiler during
freezing.  Adding the following line to the only feature in the class
and compiling from scratch prevents the error from occurring:
		io.putstring ("In violate_loop%N");

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
Fixed in Prerelease 93.07.15.
