test_name 	finalize-skip-rescue-clause
test_description A particular function `f' with a rescue clause calls another function. When this called function raises an exception, the rescue clause of `f' is not executed and there is no retry.  The rescue clause of the caller of `f' is executed instead.  This incorrect behavior only occurs if the system is finalized.
