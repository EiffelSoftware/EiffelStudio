	<paragraph>
		<paragraph>The following sections describe a set of examples showing how to use    EiffelNet to build client-server applications.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The examples start with the most simple uses involving high-level    classes covering common cases and shielding developers from details of    the mechanism. Subsequent examples will reveal some of these details,    useful for more advanced or specific applications of EiffelNet.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>All the examples discussed here appear in the directory 
			<italic>$ISE_EIFFEL/examples/net</italic>    of the Eiffel distribution.
		</paragraph>
		<warning>
			<bold>Caution</bold>: On Windows, the `advanced' and the `same_mach' are not    working since they are using specific code to Unix Operating systems.
