##############################################################################

Changes from version 2.4.1 to version 2.4.2:
- Security fix in formatted output functions (buffer overflow).
- Formatted output functions: 6 is now the default value for
  empty precision field with %Rf.
- Better portability of configure script.
- Detection of intmax_t and uintmax_t types.
- Improved documentation: mpfr_get_z_exp, mpfr_strtofr, mpfr_get_str and
  formatted output functions.
- Improved message in case of assertion failure.
- Test coverage: 97.0% lines of code.
- Updated tcmp_ld test to really test the long double.
- Some documentation files are installed in $docdir.
- Removed mpfr_init_cache (unused and undocumented function).
- Fixed the way $CC / $CFLAGS are got from gmp.h (__GMP_CC / __GMP_CFLAGS).
- Bug fixes.
- Also note that GCC 4.4.0 (only this obsolete version) does not build
  MPFR 2.4.2 correctly; this is detected by "make check" (failures in
  tget_z and tpow_all).

Changes from version 2.4.0 to version 2.4.1:
- Security fix in mpfr_snprintf and mpfr_vsnprintf (buffer overflow).
- Configure: new checks for length modifiers 'hh' and 'll' (new in C99)
  as 'hh' is absent on alpha-OSF1-V5.
- Miscellaneous corrections in the MPFR manual. In particular,
  mpfr_inits, mpfr_inits2, mpfr_clears and MPFR_DECL_INIT have been
  in the public API since MPFR 2.4.0.

Changes from versions 2.3.* to version 2.4.0:
- The "andouillette sauce moutarde" release.
- MPFR is now a GNU package.
- Changes in the behavior of mpfr_strtofr and in its documentation
  concerning particular cases where the code and the documentation
  did not match; this change is also present in MPFR 2.3.1.
- Behavior of mpfr_check_range changed: if the value is an inexact
  infinity, the overflow flag is set (in case it was lost); this
  change is also present in MPFR 2.3.2.
- Function mpfr_init_gmp_rand (only defined when building MPFR without
  the --with-gmp-build configure option) is no longer defined at all.
  This function was private and not documented, and was used only in
  the MPFR test suite. User code that calls it is regarded as broken
  and may fail as a consequence. Running the old test suite against
  MPFR 2.4.0 may also fail.
- New functions:
  * between a MPFR number and a double: mpfr_add_d, mpfr_sub_d,
    mpfr_d_sub, mpfr_mul_d, mpfr_div_d, mpfr_d_div,
  * formatted input/output:
    mpfr_printf, mpfr_fprintf, mpfr_vprintf, mpfr_vfprintf,
    mpfr_sprintf, mpfr_snprintf, mpfr_vsprintf, mpfr_vsnprintf,
    mpfr_asprintf, mpfr_vasprintf.
  * mpfr_sinh_cosh, mpfr_li2, mpfr_modf, mpfr_fmod, mpfr_rec_sqrt.
- Configure test for TLS support.
- Get default $CC and $CFLAGS from gmp.h (__GMP_CC / __GMP_CFLAGS,
  which are available as of GMP 4.2.3).
- Documented the fact that mpfr_random and mpfr_random2 will be
  suppressed in the next release, and that the specification of
  mpfr_eq may change in the next release (for compatibility with
  the mpf layer of GMP).
- Test coverage: 96.7% lines of code
- Bug fixes.

Changes from versions 2.2.* to version 2.3.0:
- The mpfr.info file is now installed in the share subdirectory
  (as required by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard); see output
  of "./configure --help".
- The shared library is now enabled by default. If the MPFR build
  fails on your platform, try the --disable-shared configure option
  to disable the shared library.
- Thread-safe support with Microsoft Visual compiler.
- New functions mpfr_j0, mpfr_j1, mpfr_jn, mpfr_y0, mpfr_y1, mpfr_yn,
  mpfr_lgamma, mpfr_remainder, mpfr_remquo, mpfr_fms, mpfr_signbit,
  mpfr_setsign, mpfr_copysign, mpfr_get_patches.
- Functions mpfr_sin, mpfr_cos and mpfr_sin_cos improved (argument
  reduction).
- More detailed MPFR manual.
- Improved tests (make check).
- Bug fixes.

Changes from versions 2.1.* to version 2.2.0:
- Bug fixes.
- new functions mpfr_set_overflow, mpfr_set_underflow, mpfr_set_inexflag,
  mpfr_set_erangeflag, mpfr_set_nanflag, mpfr_erfc, mpfr_atan2, mpfr_pow_z,
  mpfr_subnormalize, mpfr_const_catalan, mpfr_sec, mpfr_csc, mpfr_cot,
  mpfr_root, mpfr_eint, mpfr_get_f, mpfr_sech, mpfr_csch, mpfr_coth,
  mpfr_lngamma.
- new macro: MPFR_VERSION_STRING
- Remove the exported MPFR variables from mpfr.h to mpfr-impl.h.
  (They were undocumented, so programs which respect the API still work).
- Grep CC and CFLAGS from GMP Makefile if possible.
- Math functions are faster (both average and worst cases).
- Better support for long double.
- Shared library of MPFR.
- Binary compatible with previous versions if you do not use undocumented
  features.
- Thread safe (if built with --enable-thread-safe).
- Logging facility.
- Change in the semantics of mpfr_out_str/mpfr_get_str when n_digits=0.
- Better locale support.

  mpfr_get_emax_min, mpfr_get_emax_max, mpfr_inits, mpfr_inits2, mpfr_clears,
  mpfr_fits_intmax_p, mpfr_fits_uintmax_p, mpfr_clear_erangeflag,
  mpfr_erangeflag_p, mpfr_rint_round, mpfr_rint_trunc, mpfr_rint_ceil,
  mpfr_rint_floor.
- new macros MPFR_DECL_INIT, MPFR_VERSION, MPFR_VERSION_NUM,
  MPFR_VERSION_MAJOR, MPFR_VERSION_MINOR, MPFR_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL.
- improved documentation.
- improved configure.
- improved portability (library and test suite).
- It handles correctly non IEEE-754 double.
- GMP internal files are not needed to install MPFR.
- It is faster with low-precision floating point.
- New global flag: ERANGE_FLAG.
- Binary incompatible with previous versions, but API compatible.
- mpfr_set_str doesn't allow anymore "@NAN@garbagechar" and "@INF@garbagechar",
  allows base 0 (detection of the base), prefix (0x, 0b), leading whitespace.

Changes from version 2.0.2 to version 2.0.3:
- Bug fixes.
- Support GMP as a shared library (not fully tested).

Changes from version 2.0.1 to version 2.0.2:
- many bug fixes and other improvements.
- new functions mpfr_prec_round (replaces mpfr_round_prec), mpfr_get_exp,
  mpfr_set_exp, mpfr_get_ld, mpfr_set_ld, mpfr_get_d_2exp, mpfr_get_si,
  mpfr_get_ui, mpfr_nextabove, mpfr_nextbelow, mpfr_nexttoward, mpfr_frac,
  mpfr_fits_*, mpfr_cmp_d, mpfr_cmpabs, mpfr_erf, mpfr_gamma, mpfr_zeta,
  mpfr_greater_p, mpfr_greaterequal_p, mpfr_less_p, mpfr_lessequal_p,
  mpfr_lessgreater_p, mpfr_equal_p, mpfr_unordered_p.
- removed functions: mpfr_print_binary, mpfr_round_prec (replaced by
  mpfr_prec_round), mpfr_set_str_raw, mpfr_set_machine_rnd_mode.
- function mpfr_isinteger renamed mpfr_integer_p.
- return type of some functions changed from void to int, for consistency.
- return type of mpfr_set_prec changed from int to void.
- new values for exponent range.
- rename internal variables.

Changes from version 2001 to version 2.0.1:
- new mathematical functions: acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, cosh,
  base-2 exponential and logarithm, base-10 logarithm, expm1, factorial,
  pow, pow_si, pow_ui, sinh, tan, tanh, ui_pow, ui_pow_ui
- other new functions: mpfr_const_euler, mpfr_dim, mpfr_fma, mpfr_hypot,
  mpfr_min, mpfr_max, mpfr_rint, mpfr_set_inf, mpfr_set_nan
- new operations with MPZ or MPQ: mpfr_{add,sub,mul,div}_[zq]
- new predicates: mpfr_inf_p, mpfr_nan_p, mpfr_number_p, mpfr_isinteger,
- add mechanism to set/check exponent range (overflow, underflow), partially
  implemented in the mpfr functions.
- efficiency: mpfr_div is now faster when the divisor has a few limbs
- rounding: now mpfr_pow implements exact rounding, and most functions return a
  ternary value indicating the position of the returned value wrt the exact one
  (thus the return value is now 'int' instead of 'void')
- complete rewrite of the configuration files
- mpfr_get_d, mpfr_{add,sub}_one_ulp now get a rounding mode as 2nd argument
- some function names did change: mpz_set_fr is now mpfr_get_z_exp,
  mpfr_print_raw is now mpfr_print_binary.

Changes from version 1.0 to version 2001:
- the default installation does not provide any more access to machine
  rounding mode, and as a consequence does not compare MPFR results with
  precision=53 to machine results. Add option -DTEST if you want to have
  access to machine rounding mode, and to check MPFR results against.
- the MPFR files do not need <math.h> any more
- the header file <mpfr.h> was split into <mpfr.h> for exported functions
  and <mpfr-impl.h> for internal functions. The user should not use functions
  or macros from <mpfr-impl.h>, since those may change in further releases.
- <mpfr.h> was modified in order to make easy a C++ interface
- MPFR now deals with infinities (+infinity and -infinity) and NaN
- the missing function mpfr_swap is now available
- mpfr_zeta was removed (was incomplete)
- mpfr_init and mpfr_init2 now initialize the corresponding variable to 0
  (like in other initialization functions from GNU MP)
- in case memory allocation fails, an error message is output
- several bugs of version 1.0 were fixed

Changes from version 0.4 to version 1.0:

- Version 1.0 now uses a standard configure/make installation.
- Version 1.0 implements all functions that are available in the MPF class
  from GMP 3.1 (except mpf_swap) and a header file mpf2mpfr.h is included in
  the distribution for easy change from MPF to MPFR.
- Version 1.0 implements new elementary functions: mpfr_sincos
- Some functions and macros have been renamed: mpfr_log2 is now
  mpfr_const_log2, mpfr_pi is now mpfr_const_pi, SIGN is now MPFR_SIGN.
- Version 1.0 uses faster algorithms for mpfr_exp, mpfr_const_pi,
  mpfr_const_log2. Compare the timings from version 1.0 and version 0.4.
- Version 1.0 corrects some bugs of version 0.4.
- The precision of MPFR variables is now named mpfr_prec, which makes it
  easier to change it, to say unsigned long long. Same for the rounding mode
  which is called mp_rnd_t.
