			<paragraph>The pixmaps used in the EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST were standard pixmaps provided with vision2, accessible through EV_STOCK_PIXMAPS. set_pixmap was used to set the EV_PIXMAP of the EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST_ROW. An agent was added to the select_actions of the EV_BUTTON which calls set_pointer_style on the desired widget. </paragraph>
