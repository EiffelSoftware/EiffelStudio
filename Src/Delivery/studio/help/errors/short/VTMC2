Error: Cannot call feature on formal generic type because more than one
       constraining type has a feature with that name.

What to do: Make sure that the name of the feature is unambiguous:
         Apply a renaming to the feature names of the constraining
         types in such a way that the name of the feature you want
         to call is unique.
