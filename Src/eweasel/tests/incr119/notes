A class has an attribute of type `BIT Weasel_bits', where
`Weasel_bits' is a very large constant integer.  After initial
compilation where the system is melted, the integer value is changed
to a very small number.  But system execution still ends with an
"unknown attribute type" panic.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
