		<paragraph>In order to launch a compilation without user intervention you need to specify the `-batch' switch in the 
			<bold>ec</bold> command line, otherwise the Eiffel compilation will be blocked. We will present below a typical example of batch processing on both Unix and Windows platforms where we want to compile a project in both frozen and finalized mode, then to launch the C compilations. At the same time we want to save the output of 
			<bold>ec</bold> and the C compilations.

			<size>3</size>Unix
		</heading>In a file called `launch_ec' you can have the following:
		<paragraph>
			<code_block>
#!/bin/sh
output_file="/output_path/OUTPUT"

cd /your_project_path

#Launch Eiffel compilation
ec -batch -ace Ace.ace -finalize -c_compile 2&amp;gt; $output_file

#Since only C compilation for finalized code is done
#Launch C compilation for frozen code

cd EIFGEN/W_code
finish_freezing &amp;gt; $output_file</code_block>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>It will go the directory where your project is located and compile your Eiffel code using the `Ace.ace' file located in your project directory and compile automatically the C code. All outputs will be stored in the file `/output_path/OUTPUT'.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			<bold>Note:</bold> All output from 
			<bold>ec</bold> are going to the error output, so do not forget to redirect the error output when you want to see the result.
