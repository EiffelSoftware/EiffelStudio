test_name 	 bogus-vd28
test_description A system has an Ace which specifies the precompiled cluster EiffelBase and also has a cluster with Cluster_tag `kernel'.  After initial compilation, the tag `kernel' is changed to `other' and the system is recompiled.  The compiler then reports an erroneous VD28 error.
