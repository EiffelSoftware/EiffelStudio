After initial compilation, an attribute which is a string constant is
changed to a variable attribute of another type, thereby introducing a
VUAR violation.  The compiler detects the violation, but when return
is pressed it continues with the compilation even though nothing has
changed.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
