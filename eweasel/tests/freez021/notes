A class calls a routine and violates its precondition.  The exception
is not rescued but printing of exception trace on failure is turned
off.  The class has a `dispose' routine which does nothing, but has an
empty rescue clause.  System execution ends with a segmentation fault
when the system is frozen.  Melted code works correctly.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
