?X: This unit produces a bit of shell code that must be dotted in in order
?X: to do a character translation. It catches translations to uppercase or
?X: to lowercase, and then invokes the real tr to perform the job.
?X:
?X: This unit is necessary on HP machines (HP strikes again!) with non-ascii
?X: ROMAN8-charset, where normal letters are not arranged in a row, so a-z
?X: covers not the whole alphabet but lots of special chars. This was reported
?X: by Andreas Sahlbach <a.sahlbach@tu-bs.de>.
?X:
?X: Units performing a tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' or the other way round should include
?X: us in their dependency and use ./tr instead.
