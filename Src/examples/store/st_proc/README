This examples illustrates the use of stored procedure.

ODBC does not support creating stored procedure, so in order to run the
example on ODBC, you should use the host DBMS to create a stored procedure
"sel_proc" which should expect three parameters:
* new_date
* new_price
* new_author
and execute the following SQL statement:
UPDATE DB_BOOK SET price = :new_price, date = :new_date WHERE author = :new_author
