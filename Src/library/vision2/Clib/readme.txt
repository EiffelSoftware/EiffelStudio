How to make the Vision2 C library `vision2.lib'?
------------------------------------------------

If you have Borland C, run `make_bcc.bat'.
If you have Microsoft C, run `make_msc.bat'.

The makefiles assume that the C-compiler is in your $PATH environment
variable.

The environment variable EIFFEL4 needs to be set to where ISE Eiffel is
installed for these compilation. (This is usually `c:\eiffel4').

To set the variable, type:

	set EIFFEL4=c:\eiffel4
