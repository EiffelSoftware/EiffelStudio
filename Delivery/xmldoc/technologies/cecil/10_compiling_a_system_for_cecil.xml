			<size>2</size>Compiling your Eiffel system for CECIL
		</heading>It is very simple to "Cecilize" your Eiffel system, that is to say make its features available from the outside through CECIL. You will compile it as you normally would - either freeze it or finalize it. The only supplementary precaution is to protect from the dead-code remover any Eiffel features that are not called from the Eiffel system's root, and might thus be dead-code-removed by the optimization mechanism.
		<paragraph>To do this, make the appropriate features and classes <link>

			<size>2</size>Building a CECIL archive
		</heading>The EiffelStudio compiler produces both C code and a "Makefile". The Makefile compiles and links that C code in a subdirectory one level below the EIFGENs directory of a project. For frozen/melted code, the Makefile is located in the W_code subdirectory. For finalized code, it is in the F_code subdirectory.
		<paragraph>To produce a CECIL library, you must: open a shell (unix) or the MS-DOS prompt (Windows), go to the subdirectory that contains the Makefile, and then type:</paragraph>
		<code_block>
		<bold>make cecil</bold> (on unix and on windows with Borland)<bold>
		nmake cecil</bold> (on windows with VC++)</code_block>
		<paragraph>This generates a CECIL archive whose name derived from the name system name of the Eiffel system, as follows:</paragraph>
		<code_block>
		lib&lt;system name&gt;.a (on unix)
		lib&lt;system name&gt;.lib (on Windows)</code_block>For example, the corresponding archive for an Eiffel system called "test", would be called either "libtest.a" (Unix) or "libtest.lib" (Windows).
		<paragraph>Note that through CECIL you can use an Eiffel system compiled in any of the Eiffel compilation modes:</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
			<item>Finalized C code. </item>
			<item>Workbench (melted/frozen) code, usually for development purposes. In this case you must copy the 
				<italic>&lt;system name&gt;.melted</italic> file ( where 
				<italic>&lt;system name&gt;</italic> is the name of your system) located in EIFGENs\&lt;target_name&gt;\W_code to the directory where you intend to execute your C application from.
			</item>
		</list>
		<note>
			<bold>Note</bold>: each time you melt the Eiffel system, the 
			<italic>&lt;system name&gt;. melted</italic> file is updated.
		</note>
		<warning>
			<bold>Caution</bold>: in the second case (workbench mode), it is not possible to call through the CECIL interface any routine that has been melted in the last compilation; this would raise the run-time exception:
			<line_break/><bold>  $ applied to melted routine</bold>
			<line_break/> The solution is simply to refreeze the system.
		</warning>
