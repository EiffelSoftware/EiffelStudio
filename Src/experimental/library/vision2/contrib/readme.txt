All components in the "contrib" cluster are not supported. Although shipped
with Vision2, the cluster is provided to provide a convenient place for useful
additions by users for users. If you have some classes that you feel would be suited for
inclusion in this cluster, then please send details to http://support.eiffel.com and
submit as a change request.
