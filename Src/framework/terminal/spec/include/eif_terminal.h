/* 
	description: "[
		Augments the facilities of the standard input/output consoles ({CONSOLE}) with functions to
		manipulate the appearance and cursor of the terminal.
		
		The implementation is based on the ANSI/VT100 terminal command interface.
		
		Note: All input and output/error operations should be done using the existing EiffelBase APIs,
		      {TERMINAL} only provides methods to manipulate the terminal. Clients may use either the
		      standard output or the standard error output stream during creation. It is not necessary
		      to create an instance of both output and error streams unless they are directed to
		      different terminal windows.
