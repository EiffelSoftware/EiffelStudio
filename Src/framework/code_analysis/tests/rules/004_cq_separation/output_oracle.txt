In class 'CAT_CQ_SEPARATION':
  (6:2): Feature not commented (CA036T): Feature 'cq_1' is not commented. A feature comment is strongly
recommended to enable clients to understand what the feature does.
  (6:2): No command-query separation (possible function side effect) (CA004T): Function 'cq_1' contains a procedure call, assigns to an attribute, or
creates an attribute. This indicates that the function changes the state of the
object, which is a violation of the command-query separation principle.
  (13:2): Feature not commented (CA036T): Feature 'cq_2' is not commented. A feature comment is strongly
recommended to enable clients to understand what the feature does.
  (13:2): No command-query separation (possible function side effect) (CA004T): Function 'cq_2' contains a procedure call, assigns to an attribute, or
creates an attribute. This indicates that the function changes the state of the
object, which is a violation of the command-query separation principle.
  (20:2): Feature not commented (CA036T): Feature 'cq_3' is not commented. A feature comment is strongly
recommended to enable clients to understand what the feature does.
  (20:2): No command-query separation (possible function side effect) (CA004T): Function 'cq_3' contains a procedure call, assigns to an attribute, or
creates an attribute. This indicates that the function changes the state of the
object, which is a violation of the command-query separation principle.
  (27:2): Feature not commented (CA036T): Feature 'proc' is not commented. A feature comment is strongly
recommended to enable clients to understand what the feature does.
  (32:2): Feature not commented (CA036T): Feature 'int' is not commented. A feature comment is strongly
recommended to enable clients to understand what the feature does.
  (34:2): Attribute is only used inside a single routine (CA054T): The attribute 'list' is used only in
feature'cq_3' from the same class. It can be converted into a
local variable.
  (34:2): Feature not commented (CA036T): Feature 'list' is not commented. A feature comment is strongly
recommended to enable clients to understand what the feature does.
