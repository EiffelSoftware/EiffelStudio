A class tries to print the generating type of the expression `create
{TEST1 [BIT n]' where `n: INTEGER is 8'.  When the system is melted,
system execution ends with an "out of memory" error.  Frozen code
works correctly, except that it prints "TEST1 [BIT_REF]" instead of
the expected "TEST1 [BIT 8]".

Discovered in release 5.4.0515.
