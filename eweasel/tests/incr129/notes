After initial compilation, a constraint is added to the formal generic
parameter of a class which is used in the generic constraint of
another class.  When the system is recompiled, the compiler correctly
reports a VTCG error.  But when the newly added constraint is removed
and compilation is resumed, the compiler dies with a segmentation
fault during degree 2.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
