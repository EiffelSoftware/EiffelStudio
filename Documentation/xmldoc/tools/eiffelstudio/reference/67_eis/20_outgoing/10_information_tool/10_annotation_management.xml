	<paragraph>
		Information Tool provides information management functions: adding, modifying and removing.
		<note>
			<bold>Note: </bold>Annotation management is only available in lists coresponding to nodes rather than tag nodes - all tags and "Items without tag".

		</heading>
		<paragraph>For each kind of nodes in the information tree, related annotations are listed in the right annotaton list. At the end of such lists, double clicking the blank line with <bold>"..."</bold> in the <bold>Name</bold> column creates a new unnamed annotation. One could modify the new entry into what he wants. See the following section <bold>Modifying</bold>.</paragraph>

			<size>2</size>Modifying
		</heading>
		<paragraph>To modify an annotation, one can use Information Tool or do it by code.</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false">
		    <item> By Information Tool, a line in the annotation list should be selected, then click into columns and activate editing/choosing mode. Once the editing area/drop down list is deactivated, the modification is done and synchronized into code automatically. </item>
		    <item> By code, one simply modifies code in the editor, or .ecf files in external editor (not recommented).

		</heading>
		<paragraph>By pressing <bold>Delete</bold>, or clicking the third button on the bottom toolbar deletes all selected annotations in the list. And corresponding code is synchronized.</paragraph>
		<note>
			<bold>Note: </bold>Annotation list can be multi-selected.
		</note>
		<note>
			All means to manage annotations via the tool are inreversible, except that the location - class or feature - has been opened in the editor, thus undo can be achieved via the editor. Removing is prompted on user demands. The tag tree is automatically updated when annotations are added/modified/removed or through system sweeping.
