After initial compilation where the system is melted, the name of a
routine in a parent class is changed, yielding a third inherited
version of a redefined feature.  The new inherited version of the
feature has no precondition, which should make the alternative
precondition of the redefined feature true.  But the precondition is
violated when the system is executed.  Execution works correctly when
the system is melted from scratch.

Discovered in Release 5.0.015.
