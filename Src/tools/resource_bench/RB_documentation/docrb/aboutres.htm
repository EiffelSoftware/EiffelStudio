<H1>Resource Bench - Integrating Windows(tm) resources to your Eiffel code<HR ></H1><P>
<P>
Resource Bench lets you generate some Eiffel Classes using the <B>Windows&#160;Eiffel&#160;Library</B>&#160;(WEL). Resource Bench was entirely written in Eiffel using WEL, Lex, Parse and Base libraries.<P>
You just need a resource file you have created (by using a text editor or a resource file editor such as Microsoft Developer Studio or Borland Resource Workshop). Resource Bench then parses this resource file and generates Eiffel source code.<P>
Because it generates automatically classes that take a long time to write by hands, the generated Eiffel code can reduce the development time of your windows project.<P>
For example, if you have 50 dialogs in your resource file, Resource Bench creates for each dialog a class with a creation routine and some routines' redefinition.<P>
