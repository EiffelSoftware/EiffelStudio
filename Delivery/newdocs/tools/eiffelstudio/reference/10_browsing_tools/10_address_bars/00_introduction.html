<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>All development windows are composed of two major components, each of which
can be centered on a given &quot;address&quot; (either a cluster, a class or a
feature). One is the editor, with which go all the peripheral tools (including the
<A HREF="../20_cluster_tool/00_introduction.html">cluster tool</a> and the
<A HREF="../30_feature_tool/00_introduction.html">feature tool</a>). The other
is the context tool, which contains for example the HYPERLINK(formatters)formatters, the HYPERLINK(diagram
tool)diagram tool and the HYPERLINK(metric tool)metric tool.<p>It is possible to
either group both components so that they share the same address (allowing to
have for instance formatter information on the class that is being edited
immediately), or to separate them (allowing to have for instance formatter
information on any class while editing a class).<p>When both are grouped, only
the <A HREF="10_main_address_bar.html">main toolbar</a>  appears, whereas when they are
separated, the <A HREF="20_context_tool_address_bar.html">context tool
address bar</a> is also displayed, since it might point to a different location
than the main toolbar.<p>The <A HREF="30_switch_data_share_mode.html">toggle data mode command</a>
allows you to switch between both modes.
