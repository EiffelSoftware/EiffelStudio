<paragraph >The most common compiling option is L (Melt): recompile thesystem, melting recent changes. The other compilation possibilitiesare F (Freeze) and Z (Finalize). After a Freeze you will need toC-compile the result using the W (W-compile) command; similarly,you can C-compile the result of a Finalize using C(F-compile).With any of these three compilation modes you will be prompted forthe name of an Ace file unless you have called the command with the-ace option along with -loop. You may either select an existing Acefile or use a template, in which case you will be able to edit thetemplate before proceeding, using the platform's default editor(such as vi on Unix and Notepad on Windows).</paragraph><warning ><bold >Caution</bold>: You cannot select a differentproject from within ec loop; also, you cannot select a differentAce file from within the command, although you may of course changethe contents of the Ace (for example by using an editor in an otherwindow).</warning><paragraph >The R option (Run) runs the application. You will be promptedfor the arguments if the application needs any.</paragraph></paragraph></document>
