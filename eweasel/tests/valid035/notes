In a generic class TEST1 [G, H -> NONE], an assignment of Void (which
is of type NONE) to an entity of type G is permitted.  But an
assignment of an entity of type H (which conforms to NONE) to an
entity of type G is rejected as a violation of the Assignment Rule
(VJAR).

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
