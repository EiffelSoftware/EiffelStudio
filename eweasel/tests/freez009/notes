A routine has an assignment attempt whose source is of type expanded
FOO and whose target is of type FOO.  When executed, the assignment
attempt correctly succeeds.  However, after wasting some memory and
presumably causing garbage collection, system execution ends with a
segmentation fault.  The generated C code appears to be incorrect.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
