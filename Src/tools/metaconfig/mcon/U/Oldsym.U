?X: This unit follows the creation of the config.sh file. It adds some
?X: special symbols: defines from patchlevel.h file if any and CONFIG,
?X: which is set to true. Then, we try to keep all the new symbols that
?X: may come from a hint file or a previous config.sh file.

?X: All the symbols that appear twice come only from config.sh (hence the
?X: two config.sh in the command line). These symbols will be removed by
?X: the uniq -u command. The oldsyms file thus contains all the symbols
?X: that did not appear in the produced config.sh (Larry Wall).
