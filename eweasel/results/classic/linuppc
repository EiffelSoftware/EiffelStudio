Test create-sub-cluster-bogus-vd30 (incr197): failed
	Description: A system with one cluster preceded by the keyword "all" in the Ace file is compiled, where the cluster does not exist.  The compiler correctly reports a VD01 error (nonexistent cluster path in Ace file). Then the cluster is created with one sub-cluster `sub' which contains the root class.  When compilation is resumed, the compiler reports a bogus VD30 error.

Then the error is removed and compilation completes successfully, but the generated C code won't compile, due to conflicting declarations for the creation procedure's routine.

Test implicit-def-create-finalize (incr202): failed
	Description: A system has a root class which explicitly names `default_create' as creation procedure and redefines `default_create' to print something. The Ace file specifies the root class, but does not specify a creation procedure.  After initial compilation where the system is melted, system execution correctly calls the redefined default_create.  But when the system is finalized with no changes, the finalized system produces no output and the redefined `default_create' has been removed by dead code removal.

A second class inherits this class and provides FOO as actual generic parameter.  The actual argument in the call to the routine is of type `expanded FOO'.  After initial compilation where the system is frozen, the actual generic parameter is changed to `expanded FOO' and changes are melted.  Then the actual generic is changed back to `FOO'.  System execution then dies with a segmentation fault.

	Description: A system has a class that inherits a deferred feature `value', which is of type string, and effects it with a string constant.  After initial compilation, the effecting feature name is changed, introducing a VCCH(1) error.  When compiler reports the error, feature is changed back to `value' and compilation finishes.  But when the system is then frozen, the compiler dies with a segmentation fault in `real_body_id'.
