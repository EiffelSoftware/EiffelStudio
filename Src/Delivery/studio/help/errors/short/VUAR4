Type error: base type of an actual argument of a separate call or of a
  source expression of a tuple field assignment is expanded and includes,
  directly or indirectly, a non-separate reference attribute.
What to do: make sure the type of the actual argument or the source
  expression is reference or does not include, directly or indirectly,
  any non-separate reference attribute.
