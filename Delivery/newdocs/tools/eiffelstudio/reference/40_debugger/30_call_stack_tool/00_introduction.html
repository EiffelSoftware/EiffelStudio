<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The call stack is the list of features that have been entered and not exited since the program started. It is a stack since before a feature exits, all
the features it calls must exit too. The last entered feature is the top of the
stack whereas the program root feature is its bottom.<p>There is one level in
the call stack, apart from the top, that has a special status and corresponds
to a special call stack element. It is the level to which all debugging tools
refer. It is user-definable, so that it is possible to move along the call stack
and have information about any level, by setting each level as the current call
stack level in its turn.<p>To keep trace of a call stack (for example in order
to indicate to other people where a problem occurred), it is possible to <a HREF="40_save_call_stack.html">save
the call stack</a> to a text file.<p>Information concerning the call stack is
spread over several graphical components:
<ul>
	<li>Information concerning the call stack in its globality is displayed in the <a HREF="10_call_stack_tool.html">call stack
      tool</a>.
	<li><a HREF="20_current_level_information.html">Information concerning the current call stack element</a> is displayed in the feature view and the locals
      view.
