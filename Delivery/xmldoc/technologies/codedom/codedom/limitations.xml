		The current implementation of the Eiffel CodeDom Provider does not support parsing Eiffel source code 
		to produce a CodeDom tree. Only code generation and compilation are supported in the current release. 
		If you would like to be notified when parsing is supported in the Eiffel CodeDom Provider please send us 
		a note at <link><url>mailto:info@eiffel.com</url><label>info@eiffel.com</label></link>.

			<content>Managed Code Only</content>
		</heading>

		Only managed code can be generated or compiled by the Eiffel CodeDom Provider. This means that the 
		CodeDom tree being compiled cannot include snippet members which use or define Eiffel external clauses.
