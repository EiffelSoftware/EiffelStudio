              <h1>Object-oriented style rules</h1>
              <img align="right" alt="Eiffel Power (TM) from ISE" src="../images/power.gif" vspace="2" width="109" height="226">
              <p>Consistency of style is important to software success. To help
              further this goal, ISE is making available for public use the
              basic style rules applied within ISE and recommended to other
              developers.
              <p>The style guide (a book chapter) is currently available in
              Acrobat PDF format.</p>
              <h2>Quality at all levels</h2>
              <p>The Eiffel method emphasizes on quality at all levels. Quality
              is in the big picture -- robust and extendible architecture,
              proper use of Design by Contract, powerful inheritance hierarchy,
              information hiding, choice of algorithms and data structures,
              designing for reuse etc. -- but also in the details. In true
              software <i>engineering</i>, no aspect is too small to be
              overlooked.
              <p>This is particularly true of mission-critical developments,
              systems that will be maintained over a long time, and reusable
              libraries. But in fact all software should be designed as if it
              were meant for the long term (if the industry had realized this
              earlier, we wouldn't even have anything to <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/general/news/97/millenium.html">write
              about the Year 2000 problem</a>), so everyone should apply good
              style rules.</p>
              <h2>(Part of the) Truth is in the details</h2>
              <p>Attention to detail is indeed one of the defining properties of
              the Eiffel method. The good news is, it costs hardly any more to
              do things right the first time around!
              <p>To help software developers apply an effective and consistent
              style in their products, we are publishing here a general
              description of the style rules that ISE uses for its own
              development and that we strongly encourage others to use too.</p>
              <h2>The style of the style rules</h2>
              <p>Rather than a separate manual, the style document is in fact a
              book chapter from <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/oosc.html"><i>Object-Oriented
              Software Construction</i>,</a> second edition (Prentice Hall,
              1997). If you don't have the book, you will miss the
              cross-references to other chapters and the bibliographic
              references.</p>
              <h2>Tool support</h2>
              Although it is always best (and not a significant extra burden) to
              follow the style rules right from the start, you can use the tools
              of the ISE Eiffel environment, especially the EiffelBench
              visual development workbench, to enforce most of the rules
              automatically.
              <p>In particular you can reformat a poorly formatted class as
              follows under ISE EiffelBench:
              <ul>
                <li>Bring up the class in a Class Tool.</li>
                <li>Change the format to <b>clickable</b>. This is a pretty-printing
                format that applies the formating guidelines.</li>
                <li>Save that form (by default this saves to a file other than the
                normal <b>.e</b> class file).</li>
                <li>After making a backup of the original, copy the saved file,
                using any appropriate tool, over the original <b>.e</b> class file.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>(If you are sure of what you are doing, you can combine the
              last two steps by doing a &quot;Save As&quot; to the original file
              under EiffelBench, but make sure you have a backup first in order
              to avoid any mistake.)
              <p>Here is an example Clickable format (at least, the beginning of
              the class) applied to the <i>LINKED_LIST</i> class from <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/announcements/98/freebase.html">free
              EiffelBase</a>.
              <p><img alt="LINKED_LIST, automatically pretty-printed by EiffelBench" src="../images/linked_list.gif" width="482" height="763"></p>
