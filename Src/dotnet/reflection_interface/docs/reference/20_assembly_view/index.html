			<h1>The assembly view</h1>

		<p>
			The assembly view lists the types of an imported assembly. The types appear in an table with both Eiffel and .NET names.<br>
			At the top of the window, the name, version, culture and public key of the selected assembly are repeated.<br>
			More than a list of types, the assembly view mainly aims at enabling you to edit types. In fact, a simple click on a type name (the Eiffel name) opens a new window, called <a href = "../30_type_view/index.html">type view</a>, giving an editable short-form of the Eiffel class.
