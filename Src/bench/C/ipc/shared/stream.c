	Maps file descriptor on STREAM structure.

	The motivation for the STREAM structure is to make it easy later to use
	sockets in place of pipes when networking code will be activated. A
	single socket descriptor may be use bidirectionnally, but a pipe is
	only for reading or writing.

	For Windows:
		This form is a little more complex.
		A stream consists of 4 components, 2 pipes and 2 events.
		Each pipe has an event associated with it.
