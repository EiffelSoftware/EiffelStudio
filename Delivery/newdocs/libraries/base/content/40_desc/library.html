						To create a DESC object representing a library and load that library,
						use  a declaration such as:</p>
						
					<CODE>
						<SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="esymbol">:</SPAN>
						<SPAN CLASS="eclass"><A HREF="../../reference/desc/spec/win32/dll_32_chart.html">
						DLL_32</A></SPAN>
					</CODE>

					<P>
						where <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN> should be replaced by whatever name you have chosen to
						denote the library in your software, and execute a creation instruction of the form:</p>
						
					<CODE>
						<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">create</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_dll</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="elocal">make</SPAN>
						(<SPAN CLASS="estring">"your_lib_name"</SPAN>)
					</CODE>
					
					<P>
						where <SPAN CLASS="elocal">your_lib_name</SPAN> is the name of the file containing the library.</p>
						
					<P>

						will be true if and only if the creation has been successful, that is to say, the
						given name did correspond to an available library, and it was possible to load it.</p>
