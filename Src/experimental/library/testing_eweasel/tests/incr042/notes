A class with a VEEN violation in the invariant is compiled and the
compiler detects the violation.  Then the invariant assertion is
deleted and the compilation completes fine.  But when the same invalid
assertion is added back into the invariant and the system is
recompiled, an exception trace results.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
