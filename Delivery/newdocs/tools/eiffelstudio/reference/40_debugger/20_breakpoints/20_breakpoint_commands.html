<h1>Breakpoint commands</h1>
<p>Located in the <b>debug</b> menu and the <b>project</b> toolbar, these three
commands allow to change the state of set <A HREF="00_introduction.html">breakpoints</a> in the system.</p>
<p>Enable breakpoints ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbench/icon_enable_bkpt_color.gif"> ), 
disable breakpoints ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbench/icon_disable_bkpt_color.gif"> ) 
and remove breakpoints ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbench/icon_del_bkpt_color.gif"> 
) have all global and local actions. Left-clicking on them has a global action:
all set breakpoints of the system will be respectively enabled, disabled, or
discarded. However, it is also possible to HYPERLINK(pick and drop reference) drop a feature or a class onto them,
in which case only set breakpoints of the feature/class will be affected. </p>

<p>Note that these commands work only on set breakpoints (that is, enabled or
disabled breakpoints). Therefore, discarded breakpoints cannot be set again
thanks to these commands. </p>
