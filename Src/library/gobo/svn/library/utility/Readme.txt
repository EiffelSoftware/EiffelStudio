Gobo Eiffel Utility Library

This library contains pattern classes as described in "Design Patterns"
from the "Gang of Four", and utility classes which does not deserve to
have a library on their own. The aim of this library is to always be under
construction.

Clusters:

config
    Parser of config files made up of name/value pairs and preprocessor
    instructions.
error
    Error messages and error handling cluster.
formatter
    Formatter classes for IO operations or string handling.
support
    Miscellaneous classes.
transcoder
    Base64 encoding and decoding.
uri
    URI classes.

A more detailed documentation for this library will be provided in
future releases.
