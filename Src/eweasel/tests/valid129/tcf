test_name 	inconsistent-vsta1
test_description A call to a static feature `feature {FOO [like Current]}.value' where FOO is declared as FOO [G] causes the compiler to report a VSTA(1) error, which says to make sure "FOO [like Current]" is just a class name and not a type specification.  But the compiler accepts `feature {FOO [STRING]}.value' and "FOO [STRING]" is a type specification.
