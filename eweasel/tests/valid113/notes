Putting a procedure call (rather than a function call) as an element
in a tuple causes the compiler to die in degree -1 if system is being
frozen.  Melting is successful, but executing the resulting system
gives an "operational stack botched" error.  Seems like there is a
missing validity constraint.

Discovered in Release 5.0.005
