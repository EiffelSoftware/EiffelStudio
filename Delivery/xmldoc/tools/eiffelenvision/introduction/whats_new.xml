			<content>A Change of Name</content>
		</heading>
		<paragraph>
			The first notable change is that EiffelEnvision has had a name change. In previous release <bold>EiffelEnvision</bold> was known as <bold>Eiffel ENViSioN!</bold> (<bold>E</bold>iffel for .<bold>N</bold>ET for <bold>Vi</bold>sual <bold>S</bold>tud<bold>io</bold> .<bold>N</bold>ET)

			<content>Project Management</content>
		</heading>
		<paragraph>
			One of the biggest changes in EiffelEnvision 2.5 is it's change to the way projects, and their files, are managed and configured. Projects are now subdiveded into 4 logical sections creating a clear distinction between <bold>project component reference</bold>, <bold>project files and items</bold>, <bold>Eiffel libraries</bold> and a <bold>group of miscellane items</bold>. 
			In addition project <link><url>url</url><label>*Cluster</label></link> management, used to manage <link><url>url</url><label>*Eiffel Class</label></link> source file, has been integrated directly into the <link><url>url</url><label>*Solution Explorer</label></link>, providing the simpliest and most direct means possible of file management.
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph>
			The way projects are configured has changed also. EiffelEnvision 2.5 abstracts a number of <bold>Project Configuration Properties</bold>, to create a set of <bold>Common Properties</bold>, in order to faciliate users in configuring projects faster and with less errors when changing between <help_link>
				<keywords>vxconBuildConfigurations</keywords>
				<tab_index>0</tab_index>
				Build Configurations
			</help_link>. In addition to this abstraction a number of addition project Configuration Properties have been added, such as Eiffel <link><url>url</url><label>*Debug Clauses</label></link> and advanced properties to tweak compilation.

		</heading>
		<paragraph>
			EiffelEnvision has had many improvements and optimizations made to the <link><url>url</url><label>*Build/Compilation</label></link> process. EiffelEnvision projects build faster than ever before. Not only has the Eiffel compiler been enhanced to 
			compile your Eiffel for .NET source files, but EiffelEnvision has a new <bold>build-as-needed</bold> mechanism. EiffelEnvision projects are now compiled as required, alloing <link><url>url</url><label>*Eiffel Class Library</label></link> projects to be added 
			to your <help_link>
				<keywords>vxurfSolutionExplorerDialog</keywords>
				<tab_index>0</tab_index>
				Solution
			</help_link> without pelanty. Regular projects also benifit from being built-as-needed; compilation are smaller and reduce overall compilation time, or sometimes requiring no compilation at all.
