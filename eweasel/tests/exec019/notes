A system which seems to be correct concatenates and prints the strings
of a manifest array many times, but eventually dies with an exception
trace.  The trace indicates that the array of string passed to the
`concat' function contained a void reference, which appears to
indicate a compiler or run-time system bug, since the actual argument
is a manifest array with 3 elements which all look like they can not
be void .

Discovered in Prerelease 93.05.17.
