			Although not necessary, it is recommended that before adding an EiffelEnvision project output to a deployment project, you build your 
			EiffelEnvision project(s). Projects that have been built prior to adding their output to the deployment project will 
			ensure all dependencies are evaluated and added to the deployment project automatically. It also serves to self-
			validate what will be included in the deployment project when built, by examining the project <help_link>

				output
			</help_link>. EiffelEnvision projects are different from 
			C#, VB.NET and other such projects. EiffelEnvision's compiler is incremental and produces many additional assembly modules 
			when not <link><url/><label>*optimizing code</label></link>, which can only be evaluated and included into the deployment 
			project once built. If you choose not to build the EiffelEnvision project before adding its output to the deployment project, 
			all newly generated files will be added automatically to the deployment project when built.
		<paragraph>
		</paragraph>
			When deploying projects for distribution, it is recommended to configure your project to <link><url/><label>*optimizing the compilation</label></link> as this will create a 
			single deployment module resulting in faster load and execution times. It is also recommended to disable generation of a project's <link><url/><label>*debug 
			information</label></link>. This will dramatically reduce file size because the debug information will not be included in the deployment project automatically.
