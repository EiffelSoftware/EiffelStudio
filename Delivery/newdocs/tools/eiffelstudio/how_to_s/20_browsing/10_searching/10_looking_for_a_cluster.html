<h1>Looking for a cluster</h1>
If you know the name of a cluster but not where it is located in the system,
there are two ways to find this out:
<ul>
<li>
You can try to find it in the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/20_cluster_tool/00_introduction.html">cluster
tool</a> by expanding the cluster tree.</li>

<li>
In a window where the context tool is independent from the editor, you
can type the name of the cluster in <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/10_address_bars/20_context_tool_address_bar.html">context
tool address bar</a>. You may use wildcards ("*" or "?") if you know only
a part of the name. You can then locate the cluster in the system by <a href="../../../reference/05_general_interface_description/10_general_interface_mechanisms/10_pick_and_drop.html">picking</a>
the cluster stone in the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/10_address_bars/20_context_tool_address_bar.html">address
bar</a> and dropping it on the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/20_cluster_tool/40_locate_command.html">view
icon</a>&nbsp;<img SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_view_small_color.gif" >
of the <a href="../../../reference/10_browsing_tools/20_cluster_tool/00_introduction.html">cluster
tool</a>.</li>
</ul>
