History

010 23-Feb-2013
    Added percent, agent and list+agent formats.
    Agent format support required addition of the agent flag, '~' 
    in place of the decoration flag ('#') (i.e. a single format 
    token can have either a decoration flag or an agent flag but 
    not both).  Alignment flags are unaffected.
    Tweaked arg parsing to interpret any single list arg as an arg
    list.  The alternative (the previous interpretation) would be 
    to allow single-arg containers but fail to recognize 
    containers for list format when they are alone in a an actual 
    arg list like an array.

009 14-Nov-2012
    Added hex dump routines (axdump, amemdump, lxdump, lmemdump)
    Updated PDF document, HISTORY.txt and README.txt
    Changed export status of pf_fmt_constants and printf_fmt_funcs to NONE
    Rebuilt and tested using Eiffel Studio 7.1

008 18-Aug-2012
    Rebuilt and tested using Eiffel Studio 7.0
    Complete void-safety, types attached by default, standard syntax

007 03-Apr-2011
    Rebuilt and tested using Eiffel Studio 6.7, void-safe

    Added in AEL_PRINTF a few front-ends to routines that set global
    values for delimiters, pad characters and error notification agent

    Added support for non-default separators when grouping decimals
    using %<c>d notation.

    Enhanced binary support to fix field width issues and to support
    1-filled fields for negative values

    Tweaked extract_token to permit '.' as a delimiter for List 
    and Decimal formats.

    Broke out decimal_out to enable custom thousands delimeter 
    when not decorated.

006 17-Feb-2010
    Compiled and tested using Eiffel 6.5 w/ standard syntax

    Updated extract_token and extract_field_width to support float
    formats missing overall width values (e.g. %%.2f)005 21-Jul-2009

    Adapted for void-safety in Eiffel Studio 6.4

    Added support for TUPLE as argument list, and for individual arguments
    in the case of a single format.  See README.txt for more details.

    Added support for printf containers, using the %L format.
    See README.txt for more details.

    Added argument type and count mismatch error and output messages.

    Renamed constants and routines inherited by AEL_PRINTF (and therefore
    by users of it) to avoid name clashes.

    Added 'decoration' support for binary and decimal formats that were
    described in previous version README but were not implemented

004 03-Dec-2008
    Fixed missing support for 64 bit integer params.

003 21-Apr-2008
    Changed type of args to FINITE to allow arg list to be original ARRAY,
    as well as other common structures, like LINKED_LISTs.
    Reformatted for consistency with other common Eiffel libraries.
    Changed license terms to Eiffel Forum License v2

002 05-February-2007
    Removed preconditions in front-end routines (printf, fprintf, etc)
    that raised exceptions on Void argument lists.  Now a Void arg list
    is replaced by an empty, non-Void one before calling the lower level
    routines.
    Updated the readme.txt file

20-Jan-2007
    Reworked floating point representation; now the fp value is broken
    into parts first, then the parts are formatted.
    Floats now can be zero-padded (only ints could be before)

07-Jan-2007
    First publicly available version
