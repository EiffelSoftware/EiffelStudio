test_name 	 redefine-to-rename-refreeze
test_description A system has a class B that inherits from class A and redefines a function into an attribute.  After the system is frozen, class B is changed so that it renames the function instead of redefining it, but it still includes the attribute that was the redefinition.  When the system is refrozen, the resulting C code compiles, but will not link due to an undefined symbol.
