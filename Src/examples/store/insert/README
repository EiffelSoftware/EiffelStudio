EiffelStore Examples
--------------------

Usage:
	book_insert

This example illustrates how Eiffel users may access their selected DB
to insert or modify objects in existing tables.

An Eiffel object, say ``a book'', described by class BOOK, is inserted
into a repository (instance of class REPOSITORY) defined 
with `db_book' access key for instance. The repository name
should match an external RDB table named `db_book'.
In example, session terminates on unexisting RDB table.

Class DB_CHANGE encapsulates features supporting
insertion statements.
SQL insert statements insert new objects into existing repositories
(i.e existing RDM tables).

Class DB_CONTROL provides facilities to manage the session,
control the DB status, and query the results.
