Instructions to build a delivery:

0 - Setting up the environment:

Make sure that "." must be in your PATH or else add it in any
script that calls `set_aliases'. Otherwise, it won't work because
`set_aliases' won't be found or some scripts used by `set_aliases'
won't be found too.

Make sure you have `pax' installed (See http://www.odi.ch/weblog/posting.php?posting=458) for more details on why we use it versus GNU tar).

1 - Preparing a delivery:

Make sure that ISE_EIFFEL and ISE_PLATFORM are correctly defined, ie
they point to an existing Eiffel installation.

Edit `set_aliases' to reflect your environment.

Launch `make_delivery' from the Delivery/scripts/unix directory as otherwise
it won't work.

2 - Producing a library for a given platform:

Launch `compile_exes $ISE_PLATFORM' where $ISE_PLATFORM is the value for
your platform.

Then `make_images $ISE_PLATFORM'.

At the end you have an ISO.bz2 and a tar.bz2 package of your delivery in the directory
where the 2 above scripts where launched.
