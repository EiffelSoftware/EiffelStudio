<h1>Introduction</h1>
<P align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/debugger/object_tool.png"></P>
<p>The object tool is a debugging tool that displays extended dynamic information
concerning one or several objects while debugging an application. This
information includes the value of all their attributes, as well as the values of
the once functions that have already been called.<p>

It is mainly composed of two trees, the 
<A HREF="05_local_view.html">local view</a> and the 
<A HREF="10_object_view.html">object view</a>. In the
toolbar are located two commands that facilitate browsing the trees: the 
<A HREF="30_remove_object_command.html">remove object command</a> 
<IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_delete_very_small_color.gif"> and the 
<A HREF="20_slice_size_command.html">set slice size command</a>
<IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_slice_limits_vsmall_color.gif">. The third
command <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_expand_string_color.gif">
 can give an expanded display of the string relative to an object, by dropping
the object onto the button. Use it if an object has a very long string
representation or a string representation that contains carriage returns, for
example.
