A compilation is started, but the compiler correctly reports a VSCN
validity violation because there are two supplier classes TEST1, each
in a different cluster.  If one of the clusters is removed from the
Ace completely, the compilation should be able to proceed, but the
compiler keeps issuing the same VSCN error message.

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
Fixed in Prerelease 93.04.21.
