		<list ordered="false">
			<item>
				<bold>EV_APPLICATION</bold> - Added `captured_widget' which returns the EV_WIDGET currently captured in the system, or `Void' if none.
			</item>
			<item>
				<bold>EV_SPLIT_AREA</bold> - Added `splitter_width' which returns the width of the splitter in pixels.
			</item>
			<item>
				<bold>EV_ANY_HANDLER</bold> - This is the only class to which `default_create' from EV_ANY is supposed to be exported. However, paticular descendents were exporting `default_create' to ANY instead. This has now been fixed.

				<list ordered="false">
					<item>
						<bold>EV_APPLICATION</bold> - `focused_widget' had a side effect which may modify the index of some containers.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_DYNAMIC_TREE_ITEM</bold> - fixed `count' which was not executing the subtree function as necessary when called.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TREE</bold> - Fixed bug in `has_recursively' which failed if there were one or more dynamic tree items contained.
					</item>

			</item>
			<item>
				<bold>Windows</bold>
				<list ordered="false">
					<item>
						<bold>EV_WINDOW</bold> - `move_actions' was always passing positive values for the x and y coordinates of the window, even if they should have been negative.

				</paragraph>
				<list ordered="false">
					<item>
						<bold>EV_ITEM_PIXMAP_SCALER</bold> - New class added which provides no new functionality, but is a clean abstraction of `pixmaps_width', `pixmaps_height' and `set_pixmaps_size' which were all defined independently in EV_TREE, EV_LIST, EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST and EV_COMBO_BOX. Your code will not be affected by this change.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TOOL_BAR</bold> - Added three new features `has_vertical_button_style', `enable_vertical_button_style' and `disable_vertical_button_style'. The default style for buttons is vertical and was the only style previously available, in which the `pixmap' is displayed above `text'. When vertical style is disabled, the `pixmap' of a button will be displayed to the left of its `text'.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TREE </bold> - No longer inherits EV_TREE_NODE_CONTAINER which is now obsolete. Made `selected' obsolete, use selected_item /= Void instead.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TREE_NODE</bold> - Now inherits EV_TREE_NODE_LIST instead of EV_TREE_NODE_CONTAINER. This provides more functionality at the level of the node, but does not change the features available in non deferred descendents, as they all previously inherited EV_TREE_NODE_LIST. Changed type of `parent' to EV_TREE_NODE_LIST from EV_TREE_NODE_CONTAINER. Removed three obsolete features - `align_text_left', align_text_center' and `align_text_right'.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TREE_ITEM</bold> - Strengthened `is_expandable' so that it checks `parent_tree' is not Void, this brings it into line with the preconditions of `expand'.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_DYNAMIC_TREE_ITEM</bold> - Strengthened `is_expandable' to check `parent_tree', in line with preconditions of `expand'. Added "valid_operands" precondition to `set_subtree_function' which ensures that you only pass a function with valid operands.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TREE_NODE_CONTAINER</bold> - Now obsolete, you should use EV_TREE_NODE_LIST instead.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST</bold> - Added missing postconditions to `align_text_left', `align_text_right', `align_text_center' and other miscellaneous features that were missing relevent postconditions.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_MENU</bold> - Tightened preconditions of `show' and `show_at' to ensure that the menu is not parented.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TEXT</bold> Added `has_word_wrapping', `enable_word_wrapping' and `disable_word_wrapping'. These features allow you to switch between horizontal word wrapping, in which lines too long to be displayed will be wrapped, and no word wrapping, in which horizontal scroll bars will be displayed, allowing you to view the complete contents of each line. Previously EV_TEXT would always wrap lines, and the default beaviour is `has_word_wrapping' as it was before these changes.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</bold> - Added `has_selection' precondition to `selected_text' which requires that `has_selection' must be True for you to call `selected_text'.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FILE_DIALOG</bold> - Added `valid_file_title' for validation of a file name excluding the path.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_STANDARD_DIALOG</bold> - Corrected postcondition of `make_with_text' which was checking that `text' was the same object as the STRING pased as an argument. This was incorrect, as `text' is cloned during the creation.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_WIDGET</bold> - Added `remove_real_target' which ensures that `real_target' is Void.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_WIDGET_ACTION_SEQUENCES</bold> - Added `mouse_wheel_actions', fired each time that the mouse wheel is scrolled.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_NOTEBOOK</bold> - Now inherits EV_FONTABLE permitting a font to be applied to the item texts.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_ENVIRONMENT</bold>
						<list ordered="false">
							<item> Added `mouse_wheel_scroll_lines' which returns an INTEGER corresponding to the  number of lines that should be scrolled in response to each mouse wheel scroll  event received.</item>
							<item>  Added `has_printer' which returns `True' if at least one printer is installed.</item>
						</list>
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_PRINT_CONTEXT</bold> - Added `horizontal_resolution' and `vertical_resolution' which return the page size in pixels of the page type selected from an EV_PRINT_DIALOG. This permits you to adjust the figure world you are printing to an EV_PRINT_PROJECTOR based on the limits of the page, as determined by `horizontal_resolution' and `vertical_resolution' in pixels.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_APPLICATION</bold> - Added `process_events_until_stopped' and `stop_processing', similar to `process_events', except the processing is executed until `stop_processing' is called.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_PRINT_PROJECTOR</bold> - Added `has_printer' check to `make_with_context', ensuring that if you are to print to a printer, at least one printer is available.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_PRINT_CONTEXT</bold> - `default_create' now initializes a set of standard values, permitting the printing to the default printer, using US letter size.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_RELATIVE_POINT</bold> - The features `set_x_abs', `set_y_abs', `set_angle_abs', `set_scale_x_abs' and `set_scale_y_abs' now all have a precondition ensuring that you may only call them while `being_positioned' is True, which is only the case during execution of a custom positioning agent. Previously, if they were called at other times, the values set would be overridden.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FIGURE</bold> - `accept_cursor' and `deny_cursor' are now available as queries.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_ABSTRACT_PICK_AND_DROPABLE</bold> - `set_accept_cursor' and `set_deny_cursor' no longer accept `Void' arguments.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FIGURE_MATH </bold> - 'line_angle' now correctly returns the angle in radians relative to world.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_ARROWED_FIGURE</bold> - 'start_angle' and 'end_angle' now work in all circumstances
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FIGURE_STAR</bold> - First line generated is now created from 'point_b'
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FIGURE_EQUILATERAL</bold> - First point generated is now based  upon 'point_b'
					</item>
				</list>
				<paragraph>
					<bold>Breaking changes</bold>
				</paragraph>
				<list ordered="false">
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TREE_NODE_CONTAINER</bold> - This class is no longer used in EiffelVision2,  and if you were relying on it, you should use EV_TREE_NODE_LIST instead. The  type of `parent' for tree nodes has been changed from EV_TREE_NODE_CONTAINER to  EV_TREE_NODE_LIST, so if you retrieve the `parent' and then attempt to iterate,  you may have declared an instance of EV_TREE_NODE_CONTAINER. In this situation,  you should simply change the definition to EV_TREE_NODE_LIST instead.

				<list ordered="false">
					<item>
						<bold>Platform independent</bold>
						<list ordered="false">
							<item>
								<bold>EV_DYNAMIC_TREE_ITEM</bold> - No longer crashes if your `subtree_function' returns Void. In this situation,  it will now behave as if the `Result' was empty.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_BOX</bold> - Attempting to dock from an EV_DOCKABLE_SOURCE while the box was empty would  not work. This has now been fixed.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</bold> - Calling `append_text', `prepend_text' or `insert_text' while `is_editable' is  False caused a precondition failure in the implementation which is now fixed.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_DOCKABLE_SOURCE</bold>
								<list ordered="false">
									<item>  It was previously not possible to dock to an empty window, as the target was  ignored in error.</item>
									<item>  Fixed bug which caused a crash if a dock was attempted to an empty box.</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_CHECKABLE_LIST</bold> - Corrected postcondition of `checked_items' which was checking  `selected_items' in error, and therefore almost always failing.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_APPLICATION</bold> - Querying `focused_widget' if the window with the focus was empty caused a  crash. This has now been fixed, and in this situation, the window itself is  returned.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_FIGURE_TEXT</bold> - Fixed handling of `preferred_fonts' from the `font', which was not taken into  account. Previously, the default font was always used.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_DYNAMIC_LIST</bold> - Fixed `retrieve_item_by_data' and `retrieve_items_by_data' which were always  performing object comparison, even when reference comparison was selected by  passing `False' as the second argument.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TREE_NODE_LIST</bold> - Fixed `retrieve_item_recursively_by_data' and  `retrieve_items_recursively_by_data' which were always performing object  comparison, even when reference comparison was selected by passing `False' as  the second argument.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_CONTAINER</bold> - Fixed bug in `unmerge_radio_button_groups' which would  crash if the container had no radio buttons.
							</item>
						</list>
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>Windows</bold>
						<list ordered="false">
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</bold> - fixed bug in `select_region' which would fail if `start_pos' was greater than  `end_pos'.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_PIXMAP</bold>
								<list ordered="false">
									<item>  `expose_actions' previously had a feature contained related to the  implementation, and calling `wipe_out' on `expose_actions' would stop the image  from being redrawn. There are now no side effects related to `expose_actions'.</item>
									<item>  Calling `copy' on a pixmap that was parented in an EV_CONTAINER, and therefore  displayed on screen had no visual effect until the window was re-painted. The  image is now updated immediately. Also, using `copy' on a pixmap in a similar  situation that was originally set with a masked icon, and passing a pixmap  created from a bitmap file would cause a crash.</item>
									<item>  Fixed display error in handling of pixmaps created from a PNG with a   transparant color, using `set_with_named_file'. The background would be garbled   and partially black.</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_LIST</bold>
								<list ordered="false">
									<item>  Calling `disable_sensitive' when already non sensitive would loose the original  selection, and calling `enable_sensitive' when already sensitive would alter  the selected item. The features will no longer alter the selection if called  twice.</item>
									<item>  Fixed result of `background_color' which was returning gray instead of white   before a color was assigned</item>
								</list>
								<bold>EV_CELL</bold> - If you removed the item, the minimum size was not updated to reflect this,  thereby retaining the minimum size as constrained by the minimum size of the  now removed item.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TREE_ITEM</bold>/ 
								<bold>EV_TREE</bold> - A call to `disable_select' on an EV_TREE_ITEM will now actually remove the  selection from the tree. Previously, the style of the item was changed, but a  call to `selected_item' on the tree would still return the item.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_FILE_DIALOG</bold> - Fixed precondition violation when you calling `set_file_name' which was  rejecting directory separators.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_DIALOG</bold> - Fixed a bug when you had two dialogs displayed modally, with the second modal  to the first. If you had a text field within the second dialog whose  `return_actions' contained an agent which would destroy the second dialog, the  `select_actions' of the `default_push_button' in the lower dialog would be  subsequently fired.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_LABEL</bold> - If a label was disabled through the disabling of a container in which it was  contained, it would sometimes not be grayed out. This has now been fixed.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_PICK_AND_DROPABLE</bold>
								<list ordered="false">
									<item>  `mode_is_target_menu' did not work for a pick and drop source whose `pebble'  was generated by a `pebble_function'.</item>
									<item>  Fixed bug where drag and drop was not working as it was attempting to perform   docking instead. If both are enabled, docking has priority.</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_COMBO_BOX_IMP</bold>
								<list ordered="false">
									<item>  Fixed `set_foreground_color' and `set_background_color' which previously did  nothing.</item>
									<item>  Fixed bug in selection. If during execution of the `select_actions' of an item  contained, you called `enable_select' on another item within the combo box,  subsequently selecting the originally selected item would no longer fire its  `select_actions'.</item>
									<item>  `enable_edit' and `disable_edit' were both causing the pixmaps of any items   contained to be no longer displayed.</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_PRINT_DIALOG</bold> - Querying `print_context' from a print dialog if a user selected "Cancel"  would previously crash.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TREE</bold> and 
								<bold>EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST</bold> - Fixed result of `background_color' which was returning gray instead of white  before a color was assigned
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_SCREEN</bold> - `widget_at_pointer_position' now returns the combo box if  the mouse pointer is held above the drop down list button of a combo box.  Previously, `Void' was returned.
							</item>
						</list>
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>Gtk</bold>
						<list ordered="false">
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TREE_NODE</bold> - Now expansion state remains the same when 'set_pixmap' is called.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_DIALOG</bold> - Fixed bug where 100 percent of CPU time was being used when dialog was shown  modally.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_WINDOW</bold> - Now sizing invariants are fulfilled when widget is destroyed, preventing  segmentation violation.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_COMBO_BOX</bold>
								<list ordered="false">
									<item>  Fixed bug where reselecting an item within the combo box list was in fact  deselecting it.</item>
									<item>  Now first item remains selected when items are added.</item>
								</list>
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_WINDOW</bold> - Fixed querying of positioning which never changes if previouslyset by  user.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_APPLICATION</bold> - Priority of `idle_actions' has been changed so that gtk will recalculate  widgets sizes before calling its idle handler, this means that all resizing is  done before idle actions are called.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_WINDOW </bold> - Now windows correctly shrink when requested size is smaller than current size
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_PICK_AND_DROPABLE</bold> - Fixed bug where if both drag and drop and docking were enabled, both would be  executed, now docking overrides drag and drop if both are enabled.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TIMEOUT </bold> - Now timeouts correctly unregister themselves on dispose preventing  segmentation violation.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_PIXMAP </bold> - Pixmap stretching now works as expected.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_WINDOW</bold> - Now all window specificeventswork as expected
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TITLED_WINDOW</bold> - Now is_displayed returns false when window is minimized.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TREE_NODE</bold> - Insertion of children at specific rows now displays as expected.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_WINDOW</bold> - Now windows have a border and are resizable to match Win32 behavior
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_SPLIT_AREA</bold> - Now 'split position' honors request when widget resize is pending
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_DRAWING_AREA </bold> - Fixed full size optimization so that all expose actions are handled correctly
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT - </bold> Fixed issue where up and down arrow keys caused widget to lose focus  unnecessarily
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_FONT</bold> - Now preferred families are taken in to account when no style is set
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>EV_STANDARD_DIALOG </bold>- Now all file handling dialogs are  resizable

					<bold>Interface modifications</bold>
				</paragraph>
				<list ordered="false">
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TITLED_WINDOW_ACTION_SEQUENCES</bold> added which is inherited only by EV_TITLED_WINDOW and provides three new action sequences :- `minimize_actions', `maximize_actions' and `restore_actions'.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TITLED_WINDOW</bold>
						<list ordered="false">
							<item> You may now only call `maximize' and `minimize' if `is_show_requested'.</item>
							<item>  When minimized, `is_displayed' now returns False.</item>
						</list>
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_BUTTON</bold> now inherits EV_FONTABLE, allowing you to modify the font displayed.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_DYNAMIC_LIST_ITEM</bold> - Corrected `off' which was using the version inherited from EV_TREE_NODE when it should have been using the version from EV_TREE_NODE_LIST instead.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_RECTANGLE</bold> - Added precondition to `intersects' which stops a Void rectangle being passed as an argument.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TOOL_BAR_SEPARATOR</bold> - Now export many inherited features to {ANY} instead of {NONE}, including `parent'.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_ENVIRONMENT</bold> - Added `supported_image_formats' which returns a LINEAR [STRING] containing all valid formats by their three letter extension.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_CHECKABLE_LIST</bold> - New class added which behaves as an EV_LIST, except that for each EV_LIST_ITEM contained, an associated check box is displayed.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_MESSAGE_DIALOG</bold> - No longer deferred, and has two creation procedures `default_create' and `make_with_text'.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_STANDARD_DIALOG</bold> - All descendents now have `make_with_text' as a creation procedure'.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TABLE</bold> - Now inherits CHAIN instead of ARRAY. This is a breaking  change, and may require some modification to your code. The inheritence from  ARRAY was seriously flawed. For example, if you were to call `extend' on an  EV_CONTAINER object that was currently referencing an EV_TABLE, then this would  fail. Now that we inherit CHAIN, this problem, among others of a similar nature  are fixed. Another advantage of inheriting CHAIN, is that the table may now be  iterated which allows for greater flexibility.
						<line_break/>
						<line_break/> The following list details some of the breaking changes, and how to fix them:
						<list ordered="false">
							<item>
								<bold>item</bold> - If you were using `item', you should change this to `item_at_position'. A  call to `item' will now return the current item.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>put</bold> - If you were using `put', you must now replace this with `put_at_position'.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>extend</bold> and 
								<bold>replace</bold> - These are now both exported, as before, they were exported to {NONE}.
							</item>
							<item>  features inherited from 
								<bold>ARRAY</bold> - These are no longer available but you may use the feature `to_array', which  returns the contents of the table represented as an ARRAY [EV_WIDGET]. This  feature is marked as obsolete, as it is temporary, to simplify the transition  to the new inheritence structure of EV_TABLE.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>count</bold> - The previous version of `count' was the one from ARRAY, which returned the  number of available (not empty) cells in the table. We now use the version of  `count' inherited from EV_CONTAINER which returns the number of widgets  currently contained. Previously, the feature `widget_count' was used to return  the number of items, but this feature has now been made obsolete. Therefore, if  you were previously using `count', replace this with `rows' * `columns', and if  you were using `widget_count', replace this with a call to `count'.
							</item>
							<item>
								<bold>item_list</bold> - This is now obsolete. You may use `linear_representation' to  retrieve the contents of the table, or simply traverse the table.
							</item>
						</list>
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FIXED</bold> - No longer inherits DOUBLE_MATH.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_VIEWPORT</bold> - No longer inherits DOUBLE_MATH.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_TEXT</bold> - `line_count' now returns the number of lines actually displayed, and not just the newline characters, as an EV_TEXT will wrap the text when necessary. The postcondition of `linecount' has been updated to reflect this change.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FILE_DIALOG</bold> Added "valid_file_name" precondition to `set_file_name'  and a new feature `valid_file_name' which checks that a file name is valid on  the current platform.

									<item>  Fixed `select_region' which was selecting an incorrect region starting on any  line except the first, when the `text' spanned multiple lines.</item>
									<item>  Fixed `selection_start' and `selection_end' which were incorrect when the  selection was not completely contained on the first line.</item>
									<item>  Fixed `first_position_from_line_number' and `last_position_from_line_number'  which were returning incorrect values when the text was wrapped.</item>
									<item>  Fixed `caret_position' and `set_caret_position' which were incorrect when the  text spanned multiple lines, and the caret was not on the first line.</item>
									<item>  `line_count' now returns the number of lines actually displayed, and not simply  the number of newline characters. To query the number of new line characters do  :- text.occurrences ('%N')</item>

For example, performing  "my_tool_bar_button.disable_sensitive" followed by "my_tool_bar_button.set_text  ("Disabled")" while the button was parented, would result in a sensitive tool  bar button. This is now fixed.</item>
									<item>  If you changed the `text' of a tool bar toggle button during the firing of the   `select_actions' of the toggle button, the button would become unchecked as a   result. This is now fixed, and changing the text will not stop the button from   becoming selected.</item>

						<bold>EV_MENU_ITEM_LIST</bold> - `parent' is now of type EV_ANY, instead of EV_MENU_ITEM_LIST as it did not hold for EV_MENU_BAR. The renaming of `parent' to `old_parent' in EV_MENU_BAR has now been removed.

						<bold>EV_TABLE</bold>
						<list ordered="false">
							<item> redefined `prunable' to `True' and implemented `prune'.</item>

						</list>
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_WIDGET</bold> - Changed type of `focus_in_actions' and `focus_out_actions' from EV_FOCUS_ACTION_SEQUENCE to EV_NOTIFY_ACTION_SEQUENCE. `is_parent_recursive' is no longer available. It has been moved to EV_CONTAINER. This was necessary to fix a catcall encountered using vision2 under .NET. The problem manifested with widgets that held items.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FIGURE</bold> - `proximity_in_actions' and `proximity_out_actions' are now obsolete.
					</item>
					<item>
						<bold>EV_FONTABLE</bold> - `set_font' now sets a copy of the font internally.
					</item>

						<item>

							<list ordered="false">
								<item>
									<bold>EV_FIGURE_POLYLINE</bold>  - Fixed `start_angle' and `end_angle' so that they are computed relative to the  first and last polyline segments. This also fixes the start and end arrows, so  that when displayed, they now actually point in the direction of their  respective line segments.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_TREE and EV_TREE_NODE</bold>  - Fixed `find_item_recursively_by_data' which failed on the `index_not_changed'  postcondition. Note that these features are now defined in EV_TREE_NODE_LIST.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_DYNAMIC_TREE_ITEM</bold> - Fixed invariant violation from EV_ITEM_LIST, when  created with `default_create'.
								</item>
							</list>
						</item>
						<item>
							<bold>Windows</bold>
							<list ordered="false">
								<item>
									<bold>EV_RADIO_BUTTON</bold>  - The default minimum height after `default_create' is now enough to display  the widget correctly.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_CHECK_BUTTON</bold>  - The default minimum height after `default_create' is now enough to display  the widget correctly.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_NOTEBOOK</bold>  - When removing a widget from a notebook, it is now visible. Previously, the  widget would be hidden.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_LIST, EV_MULTI_COLUMN_LIST, EV_TREE</bold>  - Fixed `set_foreground_color' and `set_background_color'. Previously, calling  these features did nothing.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_BOX</bold>  - If a widget was not`is_item_expanded', then adding a new widget to the box  before that widget would sometimes cause a different widget to become  `is_item_expanded'.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_TOOL_BAR_RADIO_BUTTON</bold>  - The currently selected button in `peers' was unselected when the button was  pressed, and not when it was really selected. This bug made it possible to make  `selected_peer' Void, which caused an invariant to fail.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_LIST_ITEM</bold>  - Calling `enable_select' when parented in an EV_LIST now also sets the item as  focused in the parent. This corrects bugs in keyboard navigation when selecting  an item programatically.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_FIXED</bold>  - The minimum size is constrained by the positions and sizes of the children  (They must be completely displayed), although when the positions of the  children were reduced, the minimum allowable size was not recomputed. This  meant that the widget would be enlarged when the positions of the children  increased, but could never be reduced in size when the positions of the  children were decreased.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_MENU and EV_MENU_ITEM</bold>  - `set_pixmap' has been implemented as previously, it did nothing.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_TABLE</bold>  - re-implemented resizing calculations to fix numerous problems when children  had minimum sizes. The minimum size now also includes the border width when  empty.

								<item>
									<bold>EV_NOTEBOOK</bold>  - `selection_actions' were called when you selected an item through  `select_item', even if the item was already selected. `selection_actions' are  now only fired when the selection changes.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_TREE_ITEM</bold>  - calling `set_pixmap' twice successively with the same EV_PIXMAP caused a  postcondition failure.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_TEXT</bold>  - Fixed `put_new_line', although it has been made obsolete, as you should just  use `append_text ("%N") instead.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_SPLIT_AREA</bold>  - Fixed crash reproducable by inserting an EV_PIXMAP directly into the split  area.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_CONTAINER</bold>  - Fixed `propagate_foreground_color' and `propagate_background_color' which  failed when one of the children was a descendent of EV_CELL.

								<item>
									<bold>EV_APPLICATION_ACTION_SEQUENCES</bold>  - `drop_actions' was being fired even when the pick and drop was cancelled.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_PIXMAP</bold>  - Previously, if you were to add an agent to an action sequence of the pixmap,  before it was parented, the agent would be removed during the parenting.

								<item>
									<bold>EV_MENU</bold>
									<list ordered="false">
										<item>  Pruning an EV_MENU_SEPARATOR when one or more EV_RADIO_MENU_ITEM were still   contained in the menu would cause occasional crashes.</item>

									<bold>EV_DIALOG</bold>
									<list ordered="false">
										<item>  Fixed `is_modal' which was previously always returned `False'.</item>
										<item>  Fixed bug with `background_color' and `foreground_color' which was not taken   into account if the dialog was shown relative or modally to another window.</item>
										<item>  If a dialog with a default cancel button was displayed using `show', then   minimizing the dialog would cause the system to fail internally.</item>
										<item>  Fix bug in `show_relative_to_window' which would cause any associated menus to   be removed.</item>
										<item>  Fixed bug in `show', as if the dialog had already been shown modelessly to a   window, then calling `show' did not show it independently, but still   modelessly.</item>
										<item>  Fixed bug with `show_actions' which would be wiped out if you called   `show_modal_to_window' and then `hide'.</item>
										<item>  `set_pixmap' will now actually display the pixmap, whereas before, no pixmap   was displayed.</item>

									<bold>EV_TEXT_COMPONENT</bold>  - Fixed `text_length' which was returning incorrect value for all descendents.

								<item>
									<bold>EV_TEXT</bold>  - Fixed `line_count' which was previously returning the correct result + 1.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_SCROLLABLE_AREA</bold>  - Fixed crash which occurred when you attempted to use `set_x_offset' or  `set_y_offset' before the area had been parented or displayed.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_FONTABLE</bold>  - Fixed bug when `font' was queried, `preferred_families' was not returned  correctly, and would always be empty.
								</item>
								<item>
									<bold>EV_CONTAINER</bold> - `set_background_pixmap' was not correctly cloning the  image of the pixmap, and the displayed image could then be modified after  setting, by changing the image of the original pixmap.
