		</heading>The new feature dialog window lets you create simple Eiffel features using the coding standards described in

			<label>Object-Oriented Software Construction, Second Edition</label>
		</link>. It takes away the drag of writing set-procedures for attributes and finding the right feature clause in your class text. The feature wizard can be invoked whenever you have a class open in a development window. It is also used by the diagram tool when creating a client-supplier link.
