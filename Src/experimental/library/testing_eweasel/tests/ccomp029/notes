A system's Ace has a visible clause which makes one routine of a class
visible.  The class inherits the routine to be made visible from
another class along with another routine called by the first and
renames both routines.  When the system is finalized with
`dead_code_removal (yes)', the generated C code won't compile.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
