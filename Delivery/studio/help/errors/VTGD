    Generic Derivation rule

    Let C be a generic class. A Class_type CT having C as base
    class  is valid if and only  if it satisfies the following
    conditions for every actual generic parameter T	and  every
    Single_constraint U appearing  in  the  constraint for the
    corresponding formal generic parameter G:

	    1 The number of Type components in CT’s Actual_generic
          list  is  the same  as the  number of Formal_generic
          parameters in the  Formal_generic_list of C’s decla-
          ration.

        2 T conforms to the type obtained by applying to U the
          generic substitution of CT.

        3 If C is expanded, CT is generic-creation-ready.

        4 If G is a self-initializing formal parameter and T
          is attached, then T is a self-initializing type.
