== libFCGI source code for the libFCGI Eiffel wrapper ==

This folder contains the source code required to compile the Windows versions of libfcgi

It is a __modified__ version to enable us to compile libfcgi on __Windows 64bits__

We used the patch located under doc\fcgi-2.4.0-x64.patch applied against the original version of libFCGI from http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/libfcgi/

This folder contains only the files related to libfcgi on Windows.

You can get the full source code at https://github.com/EiffelSoftware/libfcgi
