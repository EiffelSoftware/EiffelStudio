test_name 	inline-pass-expanded
test_description A class `TEST1' has a routine `f (x: like Current): like x' with body `Result := x'.  A second class `expanded TEST2' inherits from TEST1. A third class calls `f' and passes it an object of type TEST2.  System execution dies with a segmentation fault, but only if the system is finalized with inlining.  Melted code, frozen code and finalized code without inlining work correctly.
