        <h1>Basic scope type</h1>
        <p>We
        need a clarification regarding the connection between metrics and
        scopes. This is a technical point and you can start using the tools
        without understanding it.

        </p>
        <p>The
        reason for this notion, “basic scope types of a metric”, is that
        some metrics are additive in a simple way across the constituents of a
        scope, but others are not. “Constituents” of a scope are the sub
        scopes according to the order relation defined earlier between scopes:
        systems for an archive, clusters for a system, classes for a clusters,
        and features for a class.

        </p>
        <p>To
        see the need for defining basic scope types, take as an example the
        elementary metric Lines, denoting the number of source lines in a
        certain scope. Then:

        </p>
        <p>•
        The metric is additive at the cluster level, in the sense that the
        number of source lines of a cluster is the sum of the corresponding
        numbers for its constituent classes.

        </p>
        <p>•
        The metric is similarly additive at the level of systems (add Lines over
        constituent clusters) and archives (add Lines over constituent systems).

        </p>
        <p>•
        The metric is, however, <b>not additive </b>at the class level, since
        the number of source lines of a class isn’t just the sum of numbers of
        source lines of its features; we must also count the lines of Indexing
        clauses, Invariant clauses and other elements of a class that are not in
        a feature.

        </p>
        <p>We
        will say that the scope types Feature and Class are the basic scope
        types of the metric Lines. This means the definition of the metric must,
        in specifying how to compute a measure for that metric over a particular
        scope, include three different algorithms, as follows.</p>

        <P CLASS="note"><b>How to compute a measure</b>:&nbsp;<br>
        The following algorithm determines how to obtain a measure by applying a
        metric to a scope:<br>
        1 • If the scope's type is one of the basic scope types of the metric, Feature
        or Class in the example, the metric's specification must
        include a predefined mechanism to compute the measure.<br>
        That mechanism will directly access properties of the software
        —through the development environment (as in ISE Eiffel), or by
        directly analyzing the source code.<br>
        2 • If the scope's type is <b>smaller </b>than all basic scope types of
        the metric —referring to the order relation between scopes: Feature
        less than Class, Class less than Cluster and so
        on — the measure will always be zero. This cannot happen with the Lines
        metric, since the smallest of all scope types, Feature, is
        one of its basic scope types. But if requested to apply the metric Parents
        (number of parents) to a feature, we should return zero, since the Class
        is the only basic scope type for this metric and Feature is
        smaller than Class. The reason for this is obvious: we are asked
        to compute the “number of parents” for a feature, but the smallest
        unit for which this metric is defined is Class, so the only
        appropriate answer is zero. (This rule is important in connection with
        the next case.)<br>
        3 • Otherwise (the scope's type is not one of the basic scope types of the metric, but <b>bigger </b>than the smallest one), the measure is the sum
        of the measures obtained, recursively, by applying the metric to all of
        the scope constituents. For example to compute Lines — the
        number of lines — over a cluster is simply to compute it for each of
        its constituent classes and add the results. This rule is recursive: to
        compute Lines over a system, we add the results of applying the
        rule to each one of its constituent clusters. </P>

		<P>To apply this definition,
        we need to know how to determine the basic scope types of any metric.
        Here is the rule: </P>

        <P CLASS="note"><b>Basic scope types of a
        metric

        </b>:&nbsp;<br>
        Every metric has a set of basic scope
        types, defined as follows:<br>
        1 • The basic scope types of an elementary metric are part of
        the metric's definition; they appear in the table of elementary
        metrics.<br>
        2 • The basic scope types of a composite metric include (recursively)
        the basic scope types of all its constituent metrics. </P>

		<P>To understand case B,
        which defines the set of basic scope types of a composite metric as the
        union of those of its constituents, we need to refer to all clauses 2
        and 3 of the preceding rules. Assume that you want to define a composite
        metric “Number of contracts” as

        : </P>

		<P>Precondition_clauses
        + Postcondition_clauses + Invariant_clauses </P>

		<P>This is a
        legitimate combination since all the constituent metrics have the same
        unit, CONTRACT_CLAUSE, and indeed represent quantities (numbers
        of contract clauses) that it is meaningful to compare or add.

         </P>
        <p>Case
        B of the definition of “Basic scopes of a metric” tells us that the
        basic scopes of the metric include both Feature, the basic scope type of
        the metrics Precondition_clauses and Postcondition_clauses, and Class,
        the basic scope type of the metric Invariant_clauses. This is what we
        want since the metric is meaningful for a feature (where it will only
        count precondition and postcondition clauses) and a class (where it will
        count all three kinds).

        </p>
        <p>Assume
        we want to compute this quantity for a certain <b>feature</b>:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The
            definition of the metric tells us that we must compute the number
            of precondition, postcondition and assertion clauses for the class,
            and add the results.

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>For
            the Precondition_clauses and Postcondition_clauses, the only basic
            scope type is Feature, which is our scope of interest, so clause 1
            of the rule on “How to compute a measure” tells us that we
            must count the precondition and postcondition clauses for all the
            features of the class.

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>For
            the Invariant_clauses metric, our scope of interest, Feature, is
            smaller than the only basic type scope of the metric, Class, so clause
            2 of the rule tells us to ignore this metric by returning a zero.
            Without this clause, we would be faced with a logical contradiction.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If,
        however, we want to apply the metric to a certain <b>class</b>:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>For
            the Precondition_clauses and Postcondition_clauses, since the only
            basic scope type of these metrics is Feature and our scope is
            bigger, clause 3 of the rule tells us to count precondition and
            postcondition clauses for all of the features of the class, and add
            the results.

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>For
            Invariant_clauses, clause 1 applies: we count the number of
            invariant clauses for the class, and add it to the previous result.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As
        this example indicates, we need rules to make the definition and
        application of metrics consistent. This enables the environment to
        provide users with a set of metrics which they can trust —even if they
        are not aware of the detail of the rules.

        </p>
