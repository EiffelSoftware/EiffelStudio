		<H1>Overview</H1>
        <P>Like EiffelBase for the Eiffel language, EiffelBase.NET is meant to
        be one of the principal contributions of Eiffel #:
			a library of fundamental structures and algorithms covering the basics of computing,
			and resulting from a "Linnaean" effort at a general-purpose taxonomy of computing
			structures.

			<LI>The Support cluster contains classes generated thanks to
              Microsoft .NET librairies. It contains fundamental classes and
              base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data
              types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and
              processing exceptions.</LI>
			<LI>The <a HREF="content/kernel/index.html">Kernel</a> cluster include core classes used in
			all Eiffel systems. These include a universal class providing facilities potentially useful
			for all classes: <a CLASS="eclass" HREF="reference/10_kernel/any_chart.html">ANY</a>.
			Every class is a descendant of this classes. The kernel also provides
			implementations of fundamental data structures: abstract structures
              describing container elements, hash tables, classes needed for
              exception handling; and more. Implementation of the kernel classes
              is based on a reuse of .NET not to loose efficiency. The goal is
              to provide classes that have names and methods closer to the
              Eiffel users habits.</LI>
