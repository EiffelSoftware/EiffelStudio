A class has two functions which each have the same expanded type as
return type.  One of the functions just lets Result get set by the
default initializations applied to locals, while the other one does an
explicit creation with Result as target.  The two functions return
results which should be equal but are not, but only if the system is
finalized.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
