<p>A pdf documentation of EiffelVision is available here.
<p>The EiffelVision library provides a solution to one of the central needs of
software developers: a high-level approach to graphical development. In
particular, EiffelVision is one of the few products that support both
&quot;GUI&quot; programming (managing windows, panels, buttons and other user
interface objects) and graphical manipulations (geometric figures - circles,
polygons and the like, including complex figures of an arbitrary level of
nesting).</p>
<p>EiffelVision is a key element of our technology; all of our current products
(e.g. EiffelBench, EiffelBuild, EiffelCase, ArchiText) use it, and most of our
customers' applications also rely on it. We are putting considerable effort into
building the next generation of EiffelVision so that it will continue to support
the needs of our customers.
<p>Portability is a key concern in EiffelVision. Even though the product evolved
in part from a Motif library, it also supports Windows programming.
<p>Even though we hear frequent siren calls - including on comp.lang.eiffel - of
the form &quot;Forget about portability, all we need is a good [fill in some API
here, usually Windows] encapsulation&quot;, we think it is our duty to Eiffel
users, and one of the major attractions of a such a library, to provide a
platform-independent solution, even if not all users are concerned about
portability yet.
<p>In fact, the relationship between portability and adaptation to specific
platforms is not necessarily &quot;either-or&quot;. This realization explains
the current direction of evolution for EiffelVision.
<p>Taking a critical look at EiffelVision, one may make two comments that at
first sight appear contradictory:
<ul>
  <li>For some, EiffelVision is too abstract: they feel that it is not close
    enough to, say, the Windows API.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>For others, EiffelVision is not abstract enough: the library's view of how
    its users should do things is still influenced by its Motif origins.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these criticisms are to a certain extent justified; but one can
answer them without contradiction. It is possible to make EiffelVision:
<ul>
  <li>1. More abstract, by removing anything that is Motif-specific or just
    Motifish.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>2. More concrete, by building platform-specific layers for each of the
    important APIs: Windows, X/Motif etc.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This is the basis of the new EiffelVision architecture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="Technical Information">Technical Information</a></h1>
<p>Task 1 is the natural evolution of EiffelVision. Cleaned up from some Motif
specificities, made more general and more powerful, EiffelVision will be even
more simple and intuitive to use, allowing a beginner to put together a
graphical application very quickly. The result, of course, will be fully
portable.
<p>Task 2 has led to the design of a new library: <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/library/wel/page.html">WEL</a>
(the Windows Eiffel Library). WEL is an encapsulation of the Windows graphical
API, meant for those developers who are focusing on Windows and want to have
access to the entire set of mechanisms of that platform.
<p>Similarly, the Motif-specific part is now encapsulated in a new library: <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/products/mel.html">MEL</a>
(the Motif Eiffel Library).
<p>EiffelVision, WEL, MEL and similar libraries are not separate developments:
the platform-specific parts of New EiffelVision are entirely programmed on top
of WEL in the Windows implementation and MEL in the Unix and VMS
implementations. So WEL and MEL are not separate developments: they are the
platform-specific parts of EiffelVision. The following picture represents the
new architecture:<center>

<p>For a user, the rationale for using either library level is clear:
<ul>
  <li>The platform-specific level (WEL, MEL, ...) provides access to all of
    Windows and most of Motif, at the expense of portability.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The EiffelVision level guarantees portability, but not all
    platform-specific facilities will be available (although it is likely that
    any really useful facility which is not present in EiffelVision at a certain
    stage will find its way into it at a later release, implemented through the
    native mechanisms on some platforms and emulated elsewhere).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to mix both level, for example to take advantage of
platform-specific GUI facilities on some platforms while keeping most of the
software portable.
<p>This approach provides a comprehensive solution to user needs.
<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of WEL is that it does more than just
cover the needs of some Eiffel developers for a direct interface to Windows
graphical mechanisms. The other audience includes anyone interested in writing
graphical applications under Windows simply, safely and effectively - whether or
not such a person is already an Eiffel user. To such people, WEL provides a much
nicer interface than the other techniques that we know of. This is due to the
benefits of the Eiffel approach -- abstraction, inheritance, command classes,
reusable components from <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/products/base.html">EiffelBase</a>
etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="Getting Started">Getting Started</a></h1>
<p>To use EiffelVision, you need to install WEL, MEL or GTK. But these library
should be installed once you have installed Eiffel Bench.</p>
<p><b><u>Remarks :</u></b></p>
<p>The following classes have been made obsolete from&nbsp;<br>
version 3.3.7:<br>
<br>
Kernel classe:<br>
IO_HANDLER<br>
<br>
Oui widget classes:<br>
LABEL_G, PUSH_BG, SEPARATOR_G, TOGGLE_BG, SCROLL_LIST<br>
LIST_MAN, MESSAGE, PROMPT<br>
<br>
Context data classes:<br>
CIRCNOT_DATA, FOCSOUT_DATA, MAPREQ_DATA, SELCLR_DATA<br>
CIRCREQ_DATA, FOCUSIN_DATA, MESSAGE_DATA, SELNOT_DATA<br>
CLRMAP_DATA, GRAPEXP_DATA, MULTIPL_DATA, SELREQ_DATA<br>
CONFNOT_DATA, GRAVNOT_DATA, NOEXP_DATA, TOGGLE_DATA<br>
CONFREQ_DATA, KEYMAP_DATA, PROPERT_DATA, UNMAP_DATA<br>
CREATE_DATA, LEAVE_DATA, REPAREN_DATA, VISIBLE_DATA<br>
DESTROY_DATA, MAPNOT_DATA, RESIZE_DATA, ENTER_DATA&nbsp;<br>
MAPPING_DATA, SCALE_DATA<br>
<br>
To include these obsolete classes into your application<br>
you must follow these steps:<br>
<br>
1. If you are using MOTIF, change the declaration of the toolkit&nbsp;<br>
   initialization from MOTIF to OBSOLETE_MOTIF (for windows, change&nbsp;<br>
   the declaration from MS_WINDOWS to OBSOLETE_MS_WINDOWS)<br>
2. Include the following clusters into your Ace file:<br>
   obsolete_oui:    "$EIFFEL4/library/vision/obsolete/oui";<br>
   obsolete_toolkit:"$EIFFEL4/library/vision/obsolete/toolkit";<br>
   obsolete_motif:  "$EIFFEL4/library/vision/obsolete/motif";</p>
<h1><a name="How to configure your Ace file">How to configure your Ace file</a></h1>
<p>In order to use EiffelVision in an Eiffel Project, you have to include in your
project, the right clusters and the right external files. Thus, you need to
configure your Ace file.<br>
You can get all the information about Ace files <a href="lace.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, we <b>strongly</b> recommend you to use the precompiled version of
EiffelVision, as the compilation of this library is pretty long.</p>
<p>If you wish or you need to compile EiffelVision you can include all the
following clusters. :</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">-- EiffelVision<br>

<p>If you want to use MEL library you can include in your Ace file :</p>
