After initial compilation an expanded class is changed to a deferred
class but another class still tries to create an instance of it.  The
compiler correctly detects the VGCC(2) error.  But when the create
instructions are removed, the compiler reports a bogus VTEC(1) error.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
