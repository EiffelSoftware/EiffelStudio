		"Eiffel system feature markers using the dynamic type set mechanism"

	remark: "[
		There are different ways to mark the features that a given feature
		recursively depends on (i.e. features that might be executed if
		the given feature is itself executed). Some may give more accurate
		results (i.e. will mark less features as used) but may use more
		memory or take longer to complete. There are currently four feature
		marker algorithms available:

		* ET_SYSTEM_FEATURE_MARKER: traverses the dependent features in the
		  context of the class they have been written in. For each feature
		  call, mark the redeclarations of this feature in the descendant
		  classes of the base class of the target as well.

		  Note that assertions are not traversed, and features used as
		  anchor of anchored types as not marked.

		* ET_SYSTEM_FEATURE_FUZZY_MARKER: it also traverses the dependent
		  features in the context of the class they have been written in.
		  The main difference with ET_SYSTEM_FEATURE_MARKER is that the
		  redeclarations of features are not marked when the feature call
		  is traversed. Instead of that, the traversal only marks the feature
		  corresponding to the static type of its target (dynamic binding is
		  not taken into account). Then only when there are no more features
		  to be traversed, mark all redeclarations of features that have been
		  marked as used during the first pass and traverse them. This avoids
		  having to traverse the descendant classes again and again for each
		  call and search for the version of the feature in these classes
		  (even when the feature was not redeclared). On the other hand it
		  will mark more features because some features may be the redeclaration
		  of a feature but in a class that is not a descendant of the base
		  class of the target. For example
		      b: B
		      b.f
		      class A feature f do ... end end
		      class B inherit A end
		      class C inherit A redefine f end feature f do ... end end
		  feature C.f will marked even though C is not a descendant of B.
		  Also replication might produce false positives because even through
		  there might be redeclaration, this is not necessarily the version
		  that has been selected in the inheritance clause.

		  Note that assertions are not traversed, and features used as
		  anchor of anchored types as not marked.

		* ET_SYSTEM_TARGETED_FEATURE_MARKER: traverses the dependent features
		  in the context of the base class of the target types of the calls.
		  For each feature call, mark the redeclarations of this feature in
		  the descendant classes of the base class of the target as well.
		  This algorithm is more accurate than the one in ET_SYSTEM_FEATURE_MARKER,
		  but uses more memory and is slower because it will need to traverse
		  the body of the features several times for each possible target type.

		  Note that assertions are not traversed, and features used as
		  anchor of anchored types as not marked.

		* ET_DYNAMIC_SYSTEM_FEATURE_MARKER: uses the dynamic type set mechanism
		  implemented in the Gobo Eiffel compiler to determine which features
		  are to be part of the resulting executable should the given feature
		  be used as root creation procedure. This algorithm in the most accurate
		  of the four, but is slower.

		  Note that assertions and debug instructions are not traversed, and
		  features used as anchor of anchored types as not marked.
