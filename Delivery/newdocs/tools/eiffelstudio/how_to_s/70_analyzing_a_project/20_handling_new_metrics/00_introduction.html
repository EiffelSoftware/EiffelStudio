        <p>The metric tool (&quot;Metric&quot; tab of the context tool) provides
        by default a set of metrics that can be used to make some measurements
        over various scopes in order to evaluate a project. These metrics are
        available in the metric menu of the metric tool.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelbench/Metrics_png/metricmenu.png" width="504" height="282"></p>
        <p align="left">This set of metrics is certainly not complete, users may
        probably want to define other metrics regarding their own needs. And
        then, since needs are different and in order to avoid an explosion in
        the number of basic metrics, we agreed on implementing only elementary
        metrics that could not be evaluated if not implemented in the tool.</p>
        <p align="left">Users can then define their own metrics. The metric tool
        provides an interface to define new metrics. click on <img border="0" src="/images/eiffelbench/icon_new_metric_color.gif" width="16" height="16">
        in the metric tool to display the following dialog:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelbench/Metrics_png/derived.png" width="450" height="601"></p>
        <p align="left">However, to avoid defining unmeaning metrics, it is not
        possible to define any kind of metrics. the tool allows linear, ratio
        and logical combination of the available metrics. See section:</p>

        <p>Further operation on new metrics are available, such as reordering
        these new metrics, deleting some of them, editing them to check (and
        possibly change) their definition, eventually, import import a set of
        metrics defined in a given file.</p>
        <p>To achieve one of these operations, click on <img border="0" src="/images/eiffelbench/icon_select_metrics_color.gif" width="16" height="16">
