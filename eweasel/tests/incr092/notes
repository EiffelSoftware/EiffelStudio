After initial compilation a constant attribute in an ancestor class is
changed from a unique constant to a constant integer, thereby
introducing a VOMB(5) error.  When the compiler detects the error, the
constant integer is changed to an integer function with no arguments.
The compiler still reports a VOMB(5) error when there is actually a
VOMB(2) error.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
