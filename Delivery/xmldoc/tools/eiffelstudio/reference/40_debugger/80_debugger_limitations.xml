		<paragraph>Limitations or known bugs for the Classic debugger:</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false" >
			<item>Expression evaluation on expanded objects are not supported for now (except for basic types)</item>
			<item>Evaluate "Precusor" will result the current feature's result (not the precursor)</item>
			<item>If you use any of the previous non supported expression in a breakpoint condition, the condition will always return True, and the debugger will stop on such condition breakpoint</item>

		<paragraph>Limitations or known bugs for the .Net debugger:</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false" >
			<item>When stepping through disabled assertions or disabled debug clauses, the debugger may show incorrect current line.</item>
			<item>When stepping through an inspect code, the debugger may show incorrect current line (especially if the inspect is not ordered)</item>
			<item>Under dotnet v2.0 beta, the debugger may have difficulties to fetch the stack values, especially during first chance exception events</item>

		<paragraph>Various known bugs for classic system :</paragraph>
		<list ordered="false" >
			<item>When stepping through an inspect code, the debugger may show incorrect current line (especially if the inspect is not ordered)</item>
			<item>Under dotnet v2.0 beta, the debugger may have difficulties to fetch the stack values, especially during first chance exception events</item>
			<item>Wrong assertion tag shown in debugger for precondition violation if violated during an exception rescue, indeed the tag remains the one from the exception</item>
