		 The root folder has two files and four subclusters.</p>

		 The file generated.txt includes a list of all the files generated by the
		wizard.

		 The file <i>component</i>.<i>log</i> contains a summary of the processing done
		by the wizard. The name of the file is the name of the definition file appended
		with log (so Figure 10 presumes that the definition file was e.g. <i>component</i>.<i>idl</i>)
		  <p>
		The folder <i>idl</i> contains the generated IDL file.

		 The folders <i>Client</i> and <i>Server</i> include the files generated
		respectively for reusing a component or creating a new component. Each consists
		of three subdirectories: <i>Include</i> comprises header files needed to compile
		the Eiffel code, <i>CLib</i> contains the generated C and C++ code as well as
		the library files. <i>Component</i> holds Eiffel code that wraps or defines the
		component. The <i>Component</i> subfolder of <i>Server</i> also includes the
		registration class. This Eiffel class contains the code needed to activate the
		component; it depends whether the component is in-process or out-of-process. You
		do not need to read or edit the C and C++ code included in <i>CLib</i> because
		the wizard automatically compiles it. It is given for information only and can
		be deleted (you need to keep the library file though). The <i>Client</i> and <i>Server</i>
		folders also have an Ace file used to compile the generated Eiffel code. In the
		case of a client, the generated code is precompiled whereas in the case of a
		server it is compiled in a normal system with the registration class being the
		root class of the system. In the case of an in-process server the Eiffel system
		is compiled into a DLL whereas in the case of an out-of-process server, it is
		compiled in a standard executable.

		 The Common folder comprises code that is used for both the server and the
		client parts. The <i>Include</i> and <i>CLib</i> directories contain
		respectively the header files and the C and C++ code. The C and C++ sources are
		not needed and can be deleted, only the library file needs to be kept for the
		Eiffel system to compile. The <i>Interfaces</i> subdirectory include Eiffel
		classes corresponding to the component interfaces and the <i>Structures</i>
		subdirectory includes Eiffel classes wrapping data structures specified in the
		definition file.
