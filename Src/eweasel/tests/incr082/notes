The "Hello weasel" program compiles and executes fine with `assertion
(all)' and no precompiled cluster.  Then file "string_8.e" is excluded
from the kernel cluster.  After the VD23 errors are reported, the
exclude clause is removed and compilation completes.  But when the
system is executed again, class invariant `name_exists' is violated in
routine `output' in UNIX_STD.

Discovered in Release 3.2.
