test_name 	when-init-expanded-local
test_description A routine has a precondition, postcondition, old expression in the postcondition and a local entity of an expanded type.  The local of expanded type is initialized at the wrong time (before the routine's precondition is even checked), but only if the system is melted. Frozen code works correctly.
