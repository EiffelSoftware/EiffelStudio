A class creates an ARRAY [expanded FOO] and then fills it up with
elements of type `expanded FOO'.  When the system is frozen with
`assertion (ensure)' and then executed it dies with a segmentation
fault while evaluating the postcondition `insertion_done' of `put' in ARRAY.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
