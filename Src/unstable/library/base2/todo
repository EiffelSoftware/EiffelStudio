Structures:

- Character streams that can read arbitrary objects (Alexander)?
- Relax preconditons of forth/back and extend_left/right?
- V_SET: weaker contracts for extend and remove (only require sets to be the same up to equivalence)
- Tree nodes should not have parent pointers? (less consistentcy problems,
more sharing possible)
- Do not rely on agents in standard sorted and hash structures
- Finite streams: filter, mapper, folder
- Extender iterator
- V_STRING, V_MUTABLE_STRING

MML:

- Add contracts to model classes
- Add disjoint union to sets
- Carlo's convention for sequence indexing?
- Efficient implementation

Overall:

- Void safety?

Disadvantages of agents vs. infinite models

- Had to introduce "filtered" instead of "intersection" with infinite set
(but user interface is better)
- Cannot express an image of a finite set under infinite map
(because of generic params)
- Cannot have "compliment" for sets and relations 

Known bugs:

- Search doesn't work properly if model objects put inside data structures (wrong meaning of the postcondition)
