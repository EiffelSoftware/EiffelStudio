The precursor construct is used in a routine inherited twice from the
same generic class with different actual generic parameters.  The
compiler thinks the precursor routine returns one type, but it
actually returns a child type so system execution fails.  If the order
of the parent clauses is switched, the compiler reports a VJAR error
instead of accepting the classes.

Discovered in Release 5.0.015.
