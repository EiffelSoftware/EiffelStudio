test_name 	external-tab-between-includes
test_description A declaration of an external routine declares the external to be a macro and specifies two include files whose names are delimited only by white space (no %" or <> bracketing).  If the white space is a tab instead of a space, only one C include is generated with the two file names run together, causing the C code not to compile.
