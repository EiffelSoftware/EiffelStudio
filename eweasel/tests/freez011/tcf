test_name 	compare-frozen-high-bit-chars
test_description A system sets a variable to the character constants `%/128/' and `%/255/' and then checks to see if the variable is equal to the value just assigned to it.  The system compiles fine when frozen, but thinks the variable is not equal to the character just assigned to it for characters `%/128/' and above.  Melted code works correctly.
