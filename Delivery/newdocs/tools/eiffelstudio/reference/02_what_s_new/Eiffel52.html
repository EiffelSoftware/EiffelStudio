		<H1>What's new in EiffelStudio 5.2</H1>
		<h2>Graphical environment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Added a status bar, which gives a lot of information, such as the
            state of the compilation or the name of the current project.</li>
          <li>Clicking feature clauses in the feature tree now centers the
            editor on the selected feature clause.</li>
          <li>More specific icons in the feature and cluster trees, so that
            identifying deferred classes and the nature of features is now
            straightforward.</li>
          <li>Up to 10 external commands can now be defined and called from the <b>Tools</b>
            menu.</li>
          <li>The new <b>Quick compile</b> command lets you recompile only the
            classes that have been edited in EiffelStudio, skipping the
            sometimes tedious degree 6, that looks for modified classes.</li>
          <li>Control picking now has a configurable effect.</li>
          <li>More improvements in usability and bug fixes.</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Compiler</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Click
          <a href="../30_compiler/60_version_history/02_52_release/00_51_to_52_changes.html">here</a> for more details on compiler improvements and full Eiffel 
          support on .NET</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Debugger</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Right-clicking on one of the run buttons will popup a dialog 
          enabling you to choose the command line argument (it is a shortcut for 
          `Project Settings'-&gt;Debug tab).</li>
          <li>Expressions can now be dynamically evaluated in the debugger. (<a href="../40_debugger/50_expression_evaluation/index.html">info</a>)</li>
          <li>Conditional breakpoints. (<a href="../40_debugger/20_breakpoints/index.html">info</a>)</li>
          <li>Classes can now define <span  class="efeature">debug_output</span> a feature inherited from 
          <span  class="eclass">DEBUG_OUTPUT</span>, whose string result is automatically displayed in the 
          debugger for all objects of that type. (<a href="../40_debugger/40_object_tool/17_debug_output.html">info</a>)</li>
          <li>Possible stack overflows can now be detected in the debugger
            before they occur. (<a href="../40_debugger/60_stack_overflow_prevention.html">info</a>)</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Libraries</h2>
        <h3>EiffelBase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved speed of search operations in <span  class="eclass">ARRAYED_LIST</span> and <span  class="eclass">HASH_TABLE</span>.</li>
          <li>Reduced number of exported features in <span  class="eclass">TUPLE</span>.</li>
          <li>Updated <span  class="eclass">INTERNAL</span> and <span  class="eclass">TUPLE</span> to accept <span  class="eclass">INTEGER_XX</span> 
          based queries/commands.</li>
          <li><span  class="eclass">STRING</span> changes:</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Fixed <span  class="efeature">is_integer</span> to return False for strings 
          of the form &quot;(-|+)[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*)&quot;</li>
          <li>Improved speed of <span  class="efeature">to_lower</span> and <span  class="efeature">to_upper</span>.</li>
          <li>Updated for ELKS 2001 conformance:
          <ul>
          	<li>Changed signature of <span  class="efeature">out</span> and <span  class="efeature">replace_substring</span> 
          to use <span class="eclass">STRING</span> instead of `like Current'.</li>
          	<li>Added <span  class="efeature">keep_tail</span>, <span  class="efeature">keep_head</span>, <span  class="efeature">remove_tail</span>, <span  class="efeature">remove_head</span> and make 
          	<span  class="efeature">head</span> and <span  class="efeature">tail</span> obsolete.</li>
          	<li>Added <span  class="efeature">string</span>, <span  class="efeature">same_string</span>, <span  class="efeature">has_substring</span>, <span  class="efeature">fill_with</span>, 
            <span  class="efeature">insert_string</span>, <span  class="efeature">insert_character</span>, 
            <span  class="efeature">as_lower</span>, <span  class="efeature">as_upper.</span></li>
          	<li>Modified <span  class="efeature">make_from_string</span> so that no sharing of internal string 
            is done.</li>
          	<li>Made <span  class="efeature">remake</span>, <span  class="efeature">replace_character</span> and <span  class="efeature">insert</span> obsolete.</li>
        	</ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelThread</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed crashes when using <span  class="efeature">join</span> or
           <span  class="efeature">terminated</span> from <span  class="eclass">THREAD_CONTROL</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelTime</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rewritten so that no additional C libraries is 
          needed. Therefore you have to update your project configuration files 
          to reflect this change, i.e. removing the include directory and the 
          object file of the old EiffelTime library.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>EiffelVision2</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <a href="../../../../libraries/vision2/content/0-_revisions/index.html">
          Click here to see list of update and modification to EiffelVision2</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>WEL</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Changed type of non-exported feature `internal_data' of 
          <span  class="eclass">WEL_WINDOW</span> from <span  class="eclass">INTEGER</span> to <span  class="eclass">POINTER</span>.</li>
          <li>Fixed a GDI memory leak when creating/releasing instances of 
          descendant of <span  class="eclass">WEL_CONTROL</span>.</li>
        </ul>
