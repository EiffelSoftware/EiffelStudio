<h1>External commands editor</h1>
<p>
From EiffelStudio, you can define up to 10 external commands. Those commands 
will have their output redirected in the output pane of the context tool. You 
can execute them through the Tools menu. A typical usage is to use those 
external commands to integrate with your source control management solution 
(e.g. CVS, Visual Source Safe,...)</p>
<p>
To define your own command, select &quot;External commands...&quot; in the Tools menu. 
Then the following dialog will appear:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../../../../../images/eiffelstudio/dialogs_and_wizards/external_commands_dialog.png" width="300" height="224"></p>
<p>With this dialog you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>add new commands</li>
  <li>edit existing commands</li>
  <li>delete existing commands</li>
</ul>
<p>To add your first command, simply click on the &quot;Add...&quot; button and the 
following command editor will appear:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../../../../../images/eiffelstudio/dialogs_and_wizards/external_commands_dialog_editor.png" width="255" height="223"></p>
<p>In this dialog you can give a name to the command, this name will be 
displayed in the Tools menu. The index is the position among the external 
commands of the command in the Tools menu. The command line is the command you 
want to execute. In order to execute correctly, the application you will execute 
needs to be in your PATH environment variable or if it is not you must provide 
an absolute path to the external command.</p>
<p>In addition to the external command name, you can pass as many options as you 
want plus the following three that will be translated before calling the 
external command:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$class_name: this will be replaced by the name in lower case of the 
  targeted class in editor</li>
  <li>$file_name: this will be replaced by the path to the targeted class in 
  editor</li>
  <li>$directory_name: this will be replaced by the directory location of the 
  targeted class in editor</li>
</ul>
