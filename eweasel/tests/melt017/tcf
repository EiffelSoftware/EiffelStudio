test_name 	melted-invariant-memory-leak
test_description A class A repeatedly calls a procedure on an instance of another class B.  Class B has a class invariant with a call to a function of class B, which in turn calls a function on an attribute of type C.  The system compiles fine, but when executed it quickly runs out of memory if the system was melted and if `assertion (invariant)' is specified in the Ace.
