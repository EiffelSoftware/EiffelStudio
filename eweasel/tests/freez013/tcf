test_name 	frozen-retried-precondition
test_description A routine's precondition calls a routine which raises an exception and then retries and succeeds.  After freezing, system execution works correctly except that after the last instruction of the root creation procedure is executed system execution ends with a segmentation fault. Melted code works fine.
