Void, which is of type NONE (not BOOLEAN or INTEGER) is accepted as a
boolean expression and as an integer expression.  According to ETL, it
should not be.  The generated C code cannot be compiled.

Partially fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.  Void is still accepted, but
generated C code compiles OK.
Executing the system results in an "invalid inspect type" PANIC.
