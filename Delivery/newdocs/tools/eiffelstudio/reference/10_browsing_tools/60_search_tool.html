		<H2>Description and usage</H2>
			<P>
			[BENCH] includes a search tool which allows you to look for a word or a pattern in the editor, the class tool, the
			feature tool or the output tool, and to replace it by another word if you want. It is located in the left part of the development window, like the cluster tool or
			the favorites for instance.</P>
			<P>To make it appear, if it is not displayed, click on the search icon <img
			src="/images/eiffelbench/icon_search_text_color.gif"> or choose the <B>Search</B> entry in the <B>Edit</B> menu.
			The search panel is divided in three parts (see Fig. 1).</P>

			SCREENSHOT (search panel)
			<P CLASS="figuretitle">Fig. 1: Search panel</P>
			<P>
			In the upper part, you will find a text field and button.
			The title of this text field is &quot;Search for&quot;: it will be used to enter the pattern you want to look for.
			The button is labelled &quot;Replace with&quot;. If you click on it, another text field will appear. If you click
			again, the second text field will be hidden. This text field will be used to enter the word which you want the
			editor to use to replace found patterns.<br>
			In the middle part of the search panel, you will find search options. They are described below.<br>
			The lower part contains two buttons: &quot;Search&quot; and &quot;Replace&quot;. Click on the first one to launch the
			search for the pattern entered in the &quot;Search for&quot; field. The &quot;Replace&quot; button will be active only if
			the &quot;Replace with&quot; field is displayed. Press this button if you want to replace the last found pattern by
			the content of the &quot;Replace with&quot; text field.
			</P>
		<H2>Options</H2>
			<P>
			The options are located in the middle of the search panel. There are five buttons, each of them corresponding
			to an option :
			<UL>
				<LI><P>Match case: If this options is selected, the search will be case-sensitive, which mean that if you
				search for &quot;example&quot;, the tool will highlight &quot;example&quot; but not &quot;EXAMPLE&quot;
				or &quot;Example&quot;, as there is no capital letter in the searched pattern.
				</P>
				<LI></P>Whole word: If this options is selected, the tool will look for isolated word. A word is isolated
				if it is surrounded by spaces or if it is at the beginnig or the end of a line. You can choose to
				consider underscores as word separators too. This has to be set in the preferences.
				HYPERLINK (Preferences)
				<P>
				<LI><P>Use wildcards: If this option is not selected, the tool will look for the exact sequence of letters
				you entered in the &quot;Search for&quot; field. If it is selected, you will be able to use '*' and '?'
				wildcards. '?' in the searched pattern is equivalent to any character. For instance, &quot;sample&quot; and &quot;simple&quot; will be
				highlighted if you look for &quot;s?mple&quot;.<br>	
				'*' is equivalent to any sequence of characters, including no characters at all. It means that if you search
				for &quot;exam*ple&quot;, every piece of text beginning with &quot;exam&quot; and finishing with 
				&quot;ple&quot; will be highlighted. Use it in combination with &quot;Whole word&quot; to search 
				for words beginning with &quot;exam&quot; and finishing with &quot;ple&quot;.
				</P>
				<LI><P>Replace all: If it is selected when you press the &quot;Replace&quot; button, every occurrence
				of the searched pattern will be replaced with the content of the &quot;Replace with&quot; field.It will
				be possible to activate this option only if the &quot;Replace with&quot; field is displayed. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>Search backward: If this options is selected, the tool will highlight the previous occurrence of
				the searched pattern instead of the next occurrence when you press &quot;Search&quot; button.
