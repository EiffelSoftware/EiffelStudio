		<p>
			The dependency viewer lists all dependencies of the selected assembly (whose name, version, culture and public key are repeated at the top of the dialog), that is imported and non-imported assemblies. <br>
			The dependencies appear in an array, containing the name, version, culture and public key of each dependency. This is useful in case there are two dependencies with the same name, but different version for example. The dependencies are automatically sorted by assembly names.<br>
			The dependency viewer is not a modal window, which enables you to have it opened while working with ISE Assembly Manager.
