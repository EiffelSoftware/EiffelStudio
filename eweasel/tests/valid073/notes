Constraint VDRD(7) prohibits redefining an external routine as an
internal one or conversely.  But a class which circumvents this
prohibition by first undefining the external routine is accepted by
the compiler.  The resulting system dies with a run-time panic when executed.

Discovered in Release 3.2.1.
