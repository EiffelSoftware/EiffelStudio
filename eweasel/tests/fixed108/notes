Violation of the Expanded Client rule (VLEC) in a class is detected,
but retrying the compilation by hitting return without changing the
offending class just resumes the compilation, which later dies a
horrible death.  Gets "illegal instruction (core dumped)".

Still not fixed in Prerelease 93.02.17.
