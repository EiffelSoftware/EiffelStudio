		<H1>Raw metrics and selection criteria</H1>
        <p>Elementary
        metrics measure patterns whose occurrences (in a product or process) can
        be counted. We need to decompose this notion further to avoid an
        explosion of the number of elementary metrics. For example the features
        of a class can be classified along several lines:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Some
            are attributes (object fields), others are routines (algorithms).

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>Some
            are inherited from a parent, others immediate (defined in the
            class).

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>Some
            are exported, others secret

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>and
        so on. Many combinations of these properties may be worth counting on
        their own: you may ask for the number of secret attributes, of exported
        inherited features and so on. But if we define all of these metrics
        independently, we will soon have too many elementary metrics, while
        still failing to satisfy user needs if we have omitted a particular
        combination.

        </p>
        <p>To
        avoid this we must identify a subset of elementary metrics as <b>raw
        metrics</b>: metrics whose results are counted directly. “Number of
        features in a class” is a raw metric. From a raw metric, we may then
        derive other elementary metrics by applying <b>selection criteria </b>such
        as “Is this feature an attribute?” or “Is this feature
        exported?” Here are the definitions:

        </p>

		<P CLASS="note"><b>Raw metric, selection
        criterion, derived metric:<br>
        </b>An elementary metric is
        either<b> raw </b>or<b> derived</b>. A <b>selection criterion </b>for
        a raw metric is a property, with a fixed set of possible values (two or
        more), characterizing the patterns or events being counted by the
        metric.<br>
        A <b>derived metric </b>is
        an elementary metric defined from a raw metric by counting only the
        patterns satisfying a certain combination of its selection criteria.</P>

		<P>The metric menu of the metric tool classifies raw and
        derived metric:</P>

		<P align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/metrics_png/raw_derived.png"></P>
        <p>A set of raw metrics and selection criteria is provided by default by
        the metric tool, see <a href="60_predefined_raw_metrics_selection_criteria.html">predefined
        raw metrics and selection criteria</a>

        </p>
        <p>To
        define a derived metric, we start from a raw metric, for example
        “number of features”, and combine some of the associated selection
        criteria. The combination may be:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>An
            “or”: for example, count all the features that are attributes or
            exported (or both).

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>An
            “and”: count all the features that are both attributes and
            exported.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our
        metric framework does not provide more general Boolean combinations,
        although they would be easy to add if necessary. Here is the interface
        provided to <a href="/tools/eiffelstudio/how_to_s/70_analyzing_a_project/20_handling_new_metrics/10_defining_new_metrics/10_defining_derived_metrics.html">define
        derived</a> metrics:

        </p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/eiffelstudio/metrics_png/derived.png">

        </p>
        <p>A
        selection criterion may have more than two possible values. Most, as in
        these examples, have just two: a feature is either an attribute or a
        routine; it is either exported or secret.

        </p>
        <p>The
        definition states that every derived metric is derived from a certain
        raw metric. This provides only two levels of elementary metrics, raw
        and derived; you may not, from an existing derived metric, derive new
        ones, since you may only associate selection criteria with raw metrics.

        </p>
        <p>As
        a general guideline, we will try to keep the selection criteria for a
        given raw metric independent. For example, to distinguish the classes
        that inherit a given class we will use the following selection
        criteria:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Heirs:
            count the number of direct heirs of a class.

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>Indirect_heirs:
            count the number of indirect heirs.

            </li>
          <li>
            <p>Self:
            count only the class itself.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other
        interesting notions are “proper descendant”, covering direct and
        indirect heirs, and “descendant”, covering proper descendants and
        descendants. We do not introduce these as separate criteria, since this
        would result in a non-independent set of criteria: every proper
        descendant is a descendant, every heir (direct or indirect) is a proper
        descendant.

        </p>
        <p>Instead
        we limit ourselves to the three criteria listed above. If you need a
        finer decomposition, it is easy, with the techniques discussed below, to define Proper_descendants and Descendants as composite
        metrics expressed in terms of the elementary metrics Heirs, Indirect_heirs
        and Self.

        </p>
        This criterion independence principle is not
        absolute, however, and in some cases we may find it clearer to define a
        new criterion even though its value is entirely determined by certain
        values of another. For example one criterion on features determines
        whether it is an attribute or a routine, another whether
        it is deferred or effective. An attribute is always
        effective, so the two criteria are not independent. Even though we could
        remove the dependency by using a single criterion with three values
        (attribute, effective routine, deferred routine), it is more convenient
        to keep two criteria. Of course the underlying counting mechanisms must
        make sure never to count an element twice even in an “or” query, as
        when a user asks for the number of features that are attributes or
        effective.
        <p>A metric is either elementary or
        composite. An elementary metric is either a raw metric, such as
        “number of features”, or a derived metric obtained from slicing a
        raw metric by selection criteria. Composite metrics are obtained from
        existing metrics (elementary, or previously defined composite metrics)
        by applying some mathematical formula. The three kinds of composite
        metrics shown on the figure will be explained shortly.</p>
