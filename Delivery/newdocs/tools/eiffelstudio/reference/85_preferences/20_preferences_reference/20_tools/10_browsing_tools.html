<h1>
Browsing tools</h1>
This sub-categories gathers the preferences related to the tools in the
left part of [BENCH] development window. There are four of them :
<table>
<tr>
<td>Label in the preferences window</td>

<td>Complete description</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Maximum number of items in history combo boxes</td>

<td>This sets the maximum number of steps in browsing that will be recorded,
i.e. the maximum number of times you will have the opportunity to press
<a href="../../../10_browsing_tools/10_address_bars/10_main_address_bar.html">the
back arrow</a>. The default value is 10.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Show only one tool.</td>

<td>If this is True, only one of the <a href="../../../10_browsing_tools/index.html">browsing
tools</a> (i.e. Features, Clusters, Search, Windows and Favorites tools)
will be displayed at a time. If it is False several tools can be shown
simultaneously. The default value is False.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Automatically expand the feature tree</td>

<td>If this is True, the <a href="../../../10_browsing_tools/30_feature_tool/10_feature_tree.html">feature
tree</a>, which contains feature names sorted by feature clauses, will
be expanded so that you can see all the features immadiately. If it is
False, you will only see the feature clauses at first and have to expand
them to reach feature names. The default value is True.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
