<H1><A name=file><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Testcase file
format</FONT></A></H1>This section describes the format of the testcase files.
These are distributed as plain text files with a file name that identifies the
<I>group</I> of tests contained in the file and a file extension (if
appropriate) of <TT>.decTest</TT>. File names will not have embedded blanks.
<P>The files are encoded using one byte per character, using 7-bit ASCII
encoding. These may be converted to Unicode by treating them as UTF-8-encoded
files or by directly converting each 7-bit character to Unicode by prefixing
nine 0 bits.
<P>
<HR align=left width="20%">

<H3><A name=syntax><FONT face=helvetica color=#006644>Testcase
syntax</FONT></A></H3>Each testcase file consists of one or more lines (the line
delimiter mechanism may vary, depending on the operating system). Within each
line, control characters (those with encodings in the range 0 through 31) are
not used.
<P>Each line is treated as a sequence of <I>tokens</I>, delimited by the start
of the line, spaces between tokens, or (after the final token) the end of the
line. There may be more than one space between tokens, and spaces may also
appear before the first token on a line and after the last token on a line.
<P>If the first two characters of a token are two hyphens (<TT>--</TT>) the
token indicates the start of a comment. The two-hyphen sequence and any
characters that follow it, up to the end of the line on which the sequence
occurs, are ignored (that is, they are treated as commentary).
<P>The lines in a file may be:
<DL>
  <P>
  <DT><I>empty</I>
  <DD>Lines with no characters, or only space characters. These lines are
  treated as commentary and are ignored.
  <P></P>
  <DT><I>comments</I>
  <DD>Lines whose first token starts a comment. These are also ignored.
  <P></P>
  <DT><I>directives</I>
  <DD>Lines which are used to control the testcase environment in some way, for
  example to change the working precision. These lines have two tokens and are
  of the form: <PRE>  <I>keyword</I>: <I>value</I>
</PRE><I></I>where the case-independent <I>keyword</I> describes the purpose
  of the directive, and the <I>value</I> is a parameter associated with the
  directive. The possible keywords and their values are described <A
  href="dtfile.html#direct">below</A>.
  <P></P>
  <DT><I>tests</I>
  <DD>Lines which describe a specific test. These lines have at least five
  tokens, and are of the form:
  <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><I>id</I> <I>operation</I> <I>operand1</I>
  <I>operand2</I> <TT>-&gt;</TT> <I>result</I> <I>conditions</I>
  <P>where the named tokens are as follows:
  <DL>
    <P>
    <DT><I>id</I>
    <DD>A short name which identifies the test. It is case-independent and
    unique in the file. In the current testcases it comprises three or four
    alphabetic characters followed by three or four digits (for example,
    <TT>divx101</TT>).
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>operation</I>
    <DD>A case-independent keyword which describes the <A
    href="dtfile.html#ops">operation</A> to
    be carried out for this test (for example, <TT>divide</TT>).
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>operand1</I>
    <DD>The first (or only) operand required for the operation. The token may be
    quoted (see below). If it is not quoted then its value is the sequence of
    characters comprising the token, taken exactly as written.
    <P>If the token is not quoted and its value is the octothorpe character
    (<TT>#</TT>, also called the hash or pound sign), the operand is a <I>null
    reference</I>. Null references are used for testing the behavior of
    implementations which can be passed numbers by reference, where a null
    reference would be an error. If this concept is not supported then tests
    containing null references should be skipped.
    <P>Otherwise, the value of the token is treated as a string, which should be
    converted to a number using the <B>to-number</B> conversion of the
    arithmetic specification. This will raise a condition if the token is not a
    valid number. If the value of the token is not a valid number then it must
    be quoted.<A name=backref.1><A
    href="dtfile.html#footnote.1"><FONT
    size=3><SUP>[1]</SUP></FONT></A></A>&nbsp;
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>operand2</I>
    <DD>An optional second operand, if required for the operation. If present,
    it has the same syntax and follows the same rules as <I>operand1</I>.
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>result</I>
    <DD>This defines the result of carrying out the <I>operation</I> on the
    operand or operands. It will either be the string form of a valid number
    (which may be quoted) or it will be the question mark character (<TT>?</TT>)
    which indicates that the result is undefined (for example, in tests for the
    X3.274 subset of the specification this is used when an error condition is
    expected).
    <P>When the result is a number, the string will be that produced by the
    <B>to-scientific-string</B> conversion in the specification, unless the
    <I>operation</I> is <A
    href="dtfile.html#ops"><TT>toEng</TT></A>
    in which case the string will be that produced by the
    <B>to-engineering-string</B> conversion.
    <P>Note that when <I>extended</I> is set (see below) then results will be
    defined even after an error, and may have the values <TT>NaN</TT> (Not a
    Number), <TT>sNaN</TT> (signaling NaN), <TT>Infinity</TT>,
    <TT>-Infinity</TT>, or <TT>-0</TT>. Zeros may also have a fractional part.
    <P></P>
    <DT><I>conditions</I>
    <DD>Zero or more tokens each of which is the case-independent name of a <A
    href="dtfile.html#condition"><I>condition</I></A>
    set by the operation. If no condition is set then no condition tokens will
    be present. </DD></DL></DD></DL>
<P>Any operand or result token may be quoted. That is, it may begin with a
delimiter which is a single or double quote character and it is then only ended
by a matching quote (which must be present and on the same line). A quote which
matches the starting quote may be included inside a quoted operand by doubling
up the quote; in this case it does not end the token.
<P>The content of the quoted token (after the delimiters have been removed and
any doubled delimiter quotes have been reduced to a single instance) forms the
value of the token. The value may contain any 7-bit ASCII characters (other than
the control characters, whose encodings are in the range 0 through 31),
including spaces or the comment start sequence.
<P>When the value of an operand token is converted to a number before use, using
the <B>to-number</B> conversion, it is subject to the values set by <A
href="dtfile.html#direct">directives</A>,
except that the <TT>precision</TT> directive is only used when the <A
href="dtfile.html#ops">operation</A> is
<TT>toSci</TT> or <TT>toEng</TT>. For other operations, sufficient precision is
used so that rounding of the operand is avoided.<A name=backref.2><A
href="dtfile.html#footnote.2"><FONT
size=3><SUP>[2]</SUP></FONT></A></A>&nbsp;
<P><B>Example:</B>
<P>Here is an example of a small testcase file, comprising some commentary, four
directives which set the version and context, and some tests. <PRE>  -- simple.decTest
  -- Testcase for some simple operations.
  Version: 2.09

  Extended:    1
  Precision:   9
  Rounding:    half_up
  MaxExponent: 999

  simp001  add       1 1 -&gt; 2   -- can we get this right?
  simp002  multiply  2 2 -&gt; 4
  simp003  divide    1 3 -&gt; 0.333333333   Inexact Rounded
  simp004  divide    1 0 -&gt; NaN Division_by_zero
  simp005  toSci  '1..2' -&gt; NaN Conversion_syntax
</PRE>
<P><B>Note:</B> Tokens and lines do not have a defined length limit, however the
current testcases are limited to a maximum token length of 1050 characters and a
maximum line length of 4000 characters.

<HR align=left width="20%">

<H3><A name=direct><FONT face=helvetica
color=#006644>Directives</FONT></A></H3>Directives are used to control the
testcase environment in some way. Each has a <I>keyword</I> (which is
immediately followed by a colon) and a <I>value</I>.
<P>The first three directives are required; no tests can be run without these
three settings being specified (that is, there is no default value for these
settings). Once set, each setting remains in force until a new directive with
the same keyword is encountered; the setting is then replaced by the new value.

        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>precision</TT> </TD>
          <TD>An unsigned positive integer. Its value is used to set the
            <I>precision</I> in the context for the following tests.
            <P>If the setting exceeds the maximum precision that can be handled
            by an implementation then following tests should be skipped (until

        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>rounding</TT> </TD>
          <TD>A word which describes the <I>rounding</I> mode to set in the
            context for the following tests. It is case-independent and will be
            one of:
            <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;ceiling <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;down
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;floor <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;half_down
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;half_even <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;half_up
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;up</TT>
            <P>If an unsupported rounding mode is set, then following tests

        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>maxexponent</TT> </TD>
          <TD>An unsigned integer which may be zero or positive. This value
            describes the absolute value of the adjusted exponent beyond which
            overflow or underflow will be raised. The following tests will
            indicate an <A
            href="dtfile.html#condition">overflow
            or underflow condition</A> if the magnitude of the adjusted exponent
            exceeds this setting. (Note that if <I>extended</I> is set, a larger
            range of exponents can be handled because subnormal values are
            allowed.)
            <P>Implementations, in general, will have fixed maximum exponent
            limits, which may not match the setting in the testcase:
            <UL>
              <LI>If the setting of <TT>maxexponent</TT> is larger than can be
              handled, then following tests should be skipped (until the setting
              is suitably reduced or the end of the file is reached).
              <LI>If the setting of <TT>maxexponent</TT> is smaller than can be
              enforced, then following tests which indicate an overflow or
              underflow condition should be skipped (until the setting is
              suitably changed or the end of the file is reached).

<P>The next two directives are optional:
<TABLE cellPadding=8>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>
      <TABLE cellPadding=4 border=1></TR>
        <TBODY>
        <TR vAlign=top></TD>

          <TD><B>Value</B> </TD>
        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>version</TT> </TD>
          <TD>A number which describes the version of the testcases which
            follow. This may be up to five digits, or four digits with an
            embedded decimal point. For example:
            <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;version: 2.01 </TT>
            <P>The meaning of the version number is not defined, except that
            later versions of testcases should have a larger version number.
          </P></TD>
        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>extended</TT> </TD>
          <TD>Either 0 or 1. This directive indicates the level of arithmetic
            needed for the following tests.
            <P>When set to 1, numbers whose value is zero may have non-zero sign
            and exponent, operations may result in subnormal values, extra
            checking is performed on the length of operands, the power operator
            has extra checking, and the results of operations are defined after
            errors (they may be 0, infinite, or NaN values). For example:
            <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;extended: 1 -- enable extended values
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;div0 divide -1 0 -&gt; -Infinity Division_by_zero
            </TT>
            <P>When set to 0 (the default), only the X3.274 subset of the
            arithmetic is required, where the sign of a zero value result is
            always 0, subnormal values raise underflow, and some other
            differences are expected.
            <P>If an implementation does not support testcases as selected by
            the <I>extended</I> setting then following tests should be skipped
            (until the extended setting is changed to an acceptable value or the
            end of the file is reached). </P></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The final directive allows testcase groups (files) to themselves be grouped
together in a hierarchy:
<TABLE cellPadding=8>
  <TBODY>

          <TD><B>Value</B> </TD>
        <TR vAlign=top></TD>
          <TD><TT>dectest</TT> </TD>
          <TD>A word specifying the file name (without extension) of another
            testcase file to be processed at this point. For example, a testcase
            which simply runs the testcases for the three division operations
            might read:
            <P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;-- divides.decTest -- Test divisions
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;dectest: divide <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;dectest: divideint
            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;dectest: remainder </TT>
            <P>Note that this directive is not an include; the current
            settings are <I>not</I> inherited by the file to be processed  that
            file must be processed in exactly the same way as if it were the

the operation is <TT>toSci</TT> or <TT>toEng</TT>. For these operations,
conditions raised during the conversion of the operand are included (this allows
the testing of conversions in both directions).
<P>The following condition names are defined, together with the name used for it
in the arithmetic specification and the IEEE 854 exception which would be raised
by the condition.

<P><B>Notes:</B>
<OL>
  <LI>The condition names are simply the names from the arithmetic
  specification, with spaces changed to underscores so each forms a single
  token.
  <LI>The <TT>inexact</TT>, <TT>rounded</TT>, and <TT>subnormal</TT> conditions
  are included in the testcases, even when <I>extended</I> is 0, to aid analysis
  and debugging. (Underflow implies all three.) <BR>The <TT>rounded</TT>
  condition indicates that an operand or the result of a test has had one or
  more zero or non-zero digits removed by rounding. That is, the number of
  digits in the <I>coefficient</I> of the result is fewer than in the
  <I>coefficient</I> of the ideal result. <BR>In contrast, the
  <TT>inexact</TT> condition indicates only that non-zero trailing digits were
  removed (that is, the result would compare unequal to the ideal result).
  <LI>The <TT>lost_digits</TT> condition can only occur if <I>extended</I> is 0.

  <LI>The <TT>insufficient_storage</TT> condition is not a predictable condition
  and so will not appear in any testcases. It is listed here as a reminder that
  some implementations could raise this condition for some tests. </LI></OL>
