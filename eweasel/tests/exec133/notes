A class has agents which are calls to a routine that takes a numeric
type (DOUBLE, REAL, INTEGER_64, INTEGER, INTEGER_16, INTEGER_8) and
prints its argument.  If the argument is left open and a lighter type
is passed as the actual argument in a tuple at the time of the call
(e.g., INTEGER_8 is passed to a routine expecting an INTEGER), the
argument is passed incorrectly in some cases.

Discovered in Release 5.2.0928.
