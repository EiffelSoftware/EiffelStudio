A class has pattern of creation of small STRINGs guided by a random
number generator.  It also has an attribute which is a BIT_REF and it
calls deep_clone on the current object after each STRING creation.
The system compiles fine when frozen with `assertion (all)', but
violates postcondition `deep_equal' of routine `deep_clone' when it is
executed.  Melted code seems to work fine.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
