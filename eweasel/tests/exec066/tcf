test_name 	 many-locals-deep-recursion
test_description A class calls a recursive routine which creates 255 strings, all fairly short.  If the depth of recursion is 22 or greater, a run-time panic occurs when the system is executed.  If the routine only creates 200 strings, then the system executes correctly up to a recursion depth of at least 1000.
