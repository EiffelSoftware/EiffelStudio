		<paragraph >You can pick every reference to a 
			<bold >development object</bold>(like a class, a feature or an execution object) with a single click on the 
			<bold >right</bold> mouse button. Then as you start moving the mouse around - not pressing any of its buttons - a pebble tracks the cursor position, and a line continuously connects the pebble to the object's original position. The pebble's shape indicates the type of the development object that you picked (oval disk for a class, cross for a feature, folder for a cluster...).
