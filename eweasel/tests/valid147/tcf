test_name 	 cluster-include-std-class-file
test_description An Ace file with a cluster which explicitly includes one of the files (test.e) contained in the corresponding directory causes the compiler to report a VSCN error, even though there is really only one file containing a class named TEST.  The error message is quite confusing.

copy_sub 	Ace $TEST Ace
copy_raw 	test.e $CLUSTER test.e
compile_melted
compile_result 	ok
