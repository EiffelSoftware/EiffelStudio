	Signal handling declarations.

	This file used to be named "signal.h", but that conflicted with the system
	header file which bears the same name... Of course, I had to use some fancy
	'cc -I' commands to really grasp how painful that could be--RAM.

 * This can lead to disasters if the interrupted routine was playing around
 * with pointers. This adds a slight overhead, but this is the price to pay
 * to have signals raising exceptions--RAM.
 * Note that these requests may have to work in a nested fashion, hence the
 * increment/decrement operations instead of plain boolean affectations.
