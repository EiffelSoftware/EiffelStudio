		<P>Every class or cluster has one or more view. Every view shows the <A HREF="contexts.html">context</A> of a class or cluster, a subset of the Eiffel system. For example, for a certain cluster, you can show only the hierarchy of the classes in it, but you could have a second view that shows only a couple of classes in it, but with all relations between them.</P>

		<P>The view combobox, as seen in the image above, can be used to add a view or switch to a previously added one. Every class and cluster has a view "DEFAULT" that is generated automatically. If you create a new view and move for example a class around in it, the "DEFAULT" view is unaffected.</P>
