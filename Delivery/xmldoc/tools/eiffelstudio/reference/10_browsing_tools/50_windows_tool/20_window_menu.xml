		<paragraph>The 
			<bold>window</bold> menu is divided into two parts. The first one is composed of the 
			<link>
				<url>30_window_related_commands.xml</url>
				<label>window-related commands</label>
			</link>. The second one is the list of all opened development windows. Clicking any of these raises the selected development window, so that it becomes the top-level window.
