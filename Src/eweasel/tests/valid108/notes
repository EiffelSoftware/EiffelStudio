A routine has explicit creation instruction with an invalid actual
generic parameter.  The creation procedure of the generic class takes
an argument of type `G' where `G' is the name of the formal generic
parameter.  The compiler should report a VTCG error, but it does not.
Compilation ends prematurely with a segmentation fault.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
