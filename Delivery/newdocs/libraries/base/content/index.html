		<H1>EiffelBase Library Content</H1>
		<P>
			EiffelBase, covered by the open-source <A HREF="../../../general/licenses/iffel.html">IFFEL license</A>,
			is one of the principal	contributions of Eiffel: a library of fundamental structures
			and algorithms covering the basics of computing, and resulting from a "Linnaean"
			effort at a general-purpose taxonomy of computing structures. EiffelBase is one
			of the most carefully designed and extensively used libraries in the object-oriented
			industry.
		<P>
			The EiffelBase library includes:
			<UL>
				<LI>A <a HREF="10_kernel/index.html">Kernel</a> that defines the core
                  classes of all Eiffel systems.</LI>
				<LI>A <a HREF="20_structures/index.html">Data Structures</a> cluster including classes for all the major data structures (sets, lists, tables etc...)</LI>
				<LI>A <a HREF="30_support.html">Support</a> cluster that provide access to the environment, basic math operations and a few other helper classes.</LI>
				<LI>A <a HREF="40_desc/index.html">Dynamic External Shared Call</a> mechanism to call functions in DLL at runtime (Windows specific).</LI>
