Instructions to build a delivery:


1 - Preparing a delivery:

Make sure that ISE_EIFFEL and ISE_PLATFORM are correctly defined, ie
they point to an existing Eiffel installation.

Edit `set_aliases' to reflect your environment.

Launch `make_delivery'.



2 - Producing a library for a given platform:

Define ISE_EIFFEL to the location where the Eiffel delivery will be
copied and ISE_PLATFORM to your current platform.

Edit `set_aliases' to reflect your environment.

Launch `compile_exes'.

At the end, in ISE_EIFFEL you have a complete delivery.
