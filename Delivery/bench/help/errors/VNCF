VNCF, chapter 13 (Conformance), page 224

     Let `G' be a formal generic  parameter  of  a  class,
     which  in  the  class  may  be  used as a type of the
     Formal_generic_name  category.   No   type   conforms
     directly  to  `G'.  If  `G'  is  not  constrained, it
     conforms directly to the type  `ANY'  (based  on  the
     corresponding  universal class) and to no other type.
     If `G' is constrained by `CT', `G' conforms  directly
     to `CT' and to no other type.
