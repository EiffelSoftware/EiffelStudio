A class with an assignment of a 20000 element manifest array of
strings to an attribute of type ARRAY [STRING] causes termination of
the compiler during pass 4 on the class, but only under very
particular circumstances.  Innocuous changes cause the system to be
compiled correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
