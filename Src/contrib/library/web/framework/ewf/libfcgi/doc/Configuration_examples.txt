= How to configure FCGI =
== Apache2/Windows ==
* in apache2/conf/httpd.conf add 
  LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so

* and for instance, you can put the following code to test the tests/eiffelweb example
 
  <IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
   FcgidIdleTimeout 60
   FcgidBusyScanInterval 120
   FcgidProcessLifeTime 1600 
   #7200
   FcgidMaxProcesses 5
   FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass 100
   FcgidMinProcessesPerClass 100
   FcgidConnectTimeout 8
   FcgidIOTimeout 3000
   FcgidBusyTimeout 3200
   FcgidPassHeader Authorization 

   
   alias /eiffelweb/ "c:/_dev/EiffelWebReloaded/library/fcgi/tests/EIFGENs/eiffelweb/W_code/"
   <Location /eiffelweb/>
     AddHandler fcgid-script .exe
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI 
     
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
   </Location>
  </IfModule>


== IIS/Windows ==
* When you install IIS on Windows 7, you just need to enable to CGI module which also include the FastCGI module
* otherwise, have a look at http://www.iis.net/download/FastCGI and also http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/375/set-up-fastcgi-for-php/
* Then open the IIS Manager
  Modules: to check you really have FastCGIModule
  Handler Mappings and then "Add Module Mapping"
     Request path: *.exe
     Module: FastCgiModule
     Executable (optional): c:\_dev\EiffelWebReloaded\library\fcgi\tests\EIFGENs\eiffelweb\W_code\eiffelweb.exe
     Name: Eiffel Web Solution using FastCGI on IIS
	

= Notes =
* The notes in this readme are very basic, mainly to test your executable. 
* You will need to configure more precisely your httpd server to fulfill your needs

== for execution ==
* On Windows, be sure to have the libfcgi.dll in your path (or in same folder as executable)
