An attribute `weasel' of a generic class is anchored to another
attribute whose type is the formal generic parameter.  A second
generic class has a constraint involving the first.  This second class
has a multi-dot call involving a nonexistent feature, but it is not
detected.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
