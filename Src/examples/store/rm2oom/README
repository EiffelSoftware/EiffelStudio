This example illustrates how RDBS tables can be
translated into Eiffel class definitions where
features are simply attributes matching the DB table fields.
Class descriptions are printed on standard output.
 
A specific repository is referred to by a name that should
match a RDB table name for which an Eiffel class equivalent
is requested.
