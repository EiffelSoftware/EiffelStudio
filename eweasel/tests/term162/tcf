test_name 	 crash-when-calling-out-on-a-formal
test_description When you call `out' on a formal generic parameter which is first generated as a CHARACTER, then the compiler would modify the byte code to use the one from DEBUG_OUTPUT, but when processing the POINTER derivation because it does not inherit from DEBUG_OUTPUT it would crash at compile time. Solution is to make sure we retrieve the byte code always from disk.
