<h1>Online Eiffel documentation</h1>


<p>
Congratulations for installing ISE Eiffel 5, featuring EiffelStudio,
the full-lifecycle environment
for quality software development, based on the
most advanced version of object technology and
the concepts of Design by Contract&#153;.

<p>
ISE Eiffel 5 is available on many platforms and is one of the
first development environments to take advantage of the Microsoft
.NET framework.

<p>
ISE Eiffel 5 comes with extensive online documentation. Please take
the time to read up on Eiffel and the EiffelStudio environment to make
