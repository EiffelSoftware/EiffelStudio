VDRD, section 8.10.26

     Redeclaration Validity rule

     Let C be a class and g a feature of C. It is valid
     for g to be a redeclaration of a feature f inherited
     from a parent B of C if and only if the following
     conditions are satisfied.

        1 No effective feature of C other than f and g has
          the same final name.

        2 The signature of g conforms to the signature of
          f.

        3 The Precondition of g, if any, begins with
          "require else" (not just "require"), and its
          Postcondition, if any, begins with "ensure then"
          (not just "ensure").

        4 If the redeclaration is a redefinition (rather
          than an effecting) the Redefine subclause of the
          Parent part for B lists in its Feature_list the
          final name of f in B.

        5 If f is inherited as effective, then g is also
          effective.

        6 If f is an attribute, g is an attribute, f and g
          are both variable, and their types are either
          both expanded or both non-expanded.

        7 f and g have either both no alias or the same
          alias.

        8 If both features are queries with associated
          assigner commands fp and gp, then gp is the
          version of fp in C.

        9 If either feature is of a type based on a once
          class, types of f and g are the same.
