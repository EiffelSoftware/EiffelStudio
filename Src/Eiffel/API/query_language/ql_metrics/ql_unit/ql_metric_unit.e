feature -- Status report

	is_scope_unit: BOOLEAN is
			-- Is current scope related to a scope directly?
			-- This is necessary in metrics calculation.
			-- If a unit is related to a scope, you can specify a criterion to it, such as in the following query:
			--
			-- 		select class where (count feature from current_class where is_immediate) > 100
			--
			-- This query will give you all the classes whose number of immediate feature is larger than 100.
			-- Here, "count feature from current_class where is_immediate" is a metric definition.
			-- and "feature" here is a unit, and further, it's a unit with a scope, which is feature scope.
			-- So we can attach a criterion "is_immediate" to it.
			-- A different exmple is compilation unit. It tells you the number of compilation in current target.
			-- It's a unit with no scope, so we can't attach any criterion to it.
