		<P>EiffelStudio editor now offers the possibility to complete feature calls automatically. This means that
		when the user types &quot;<i>an_identifier.an_incomplete_feature_name</i>&quot; and then triggers the
        auto-complete, the
		editor will propose a list of possible feature names correct in this situation.<BR>To be more
		precise, a window will pop up and display the list of features that can be called on
		<i>an_identifier</i> and that <i>an_incomplete_feature_name</i>. The user can accept the suggested name, choose another name (in the list or not), or simply
		cancel the auto-complete.
		</P>
		SCREENSHOT (autocomplete window)<P>To trigger the autocomplete, press the key combination &quot;Ctrl+Space&quot; or click on
		<B>Complete word</B> in the <B>Advanced</B> sub-menu of the <B><a href="../80_edit_menu_commands.html">Edit</a></B> <a href="../80_edit_menu_commands.html">
        menu</a>. If automatic completion is
		possible, there are two cases : If only one name match, this name will
        be inserted in the editor. If there are no matching name or several one a window will
        appear. This window will contain a text field and a list. The text field will be
		filled with the beginning of the feature name you entered. The first item
       in the list, if	any, will be selected.<BR>
		To complete your code with the selected item, press &quot;Enter&quot; or &quot;Ctrl+Space&quot;.<BR>
		To choose another item, use keyboard Up and Down arrows or the mouse. You can also modify the
		content of the text field. The list will be updated automatically. To validate your choice,
		press &quot;Enter&quot; or &quot;Ctrl+Space". If there is no selected item, the content of the text field
		will be inserted.<BR>
		To cancel the auto-complete, press &quot;Esc&quot; at any time.

              auto-complete right after the
			previous completion. There is no need to type a period.

              auto-complete window will then
