		<p>
			The third screen of the .NET wizard enables you to select the type of the .NET application you want to create, that is an executable file or a dynamic-link library. <br>
			It also gives you the opportunity to choose the root class name of the system and the creation routine name. By default, the wizard will create a root class named `APPLICATION' with a creation routine `make'. But you only have to type in the corresponding text fields to change the default values and personnalize your application.
