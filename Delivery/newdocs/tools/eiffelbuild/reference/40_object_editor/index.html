<P>An object editor is a tool which allows you to edit the properties of a selected <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A>. Common properties include minimum width and height, color, text etc.</P>
<P>An object editor can only reference one <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> at once, and when not empty, it is considered to be "targeted" to the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> whose properties it references.</P>
<P align="center"><IMG SRC="/images/eiffelbuild/screenshots/object_editor.png"></p>
<P>The screenshot above shows a floating object editor. The docked object editor is almost identical except that it is located within the EiffelBuild main window.</P>

<H2>Docked object editor</H2>
<P>The docked object editor is displayed to the right hand side of the EifflBuild main window. This editor is always displayed and is permanently linked to the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/20_layout_constructor/index.html">layout constructor</A>. This means that whenever the selected <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> changes in the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/20_layout_constructor/index.html">layout constructor</A>, the docked object editor becomes targeted to this <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A>.</P>

<H2>Floating object editors</H2>
<P>These object editors appear in their own window, and you may open as many of these as you wish.</P><P> To open a new floating object editor, <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#pick_and_drop">drop</A> an <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> on to the <img SRC="/images/eiffelbuild/icon_object_editor_color.png" > button which is displayed in the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/10_general_interface_description/20_main_toolbars.html">main toolbar</A> and also in each existing object editor. The new object editor will then be targeted to the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> that was <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#pick_and_drop">dropped</A>.</P>
<P>As a shortcut to a complete <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#pick_and_drop">pick and drop</A> transport, you may hold down the Ctrl key while starting the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#pick_and_drop">pick</A>, which will immediately open a new floating object editor targeted to the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> you clicked.</P>

<H2>General use</H2>
<P>When an object editor is targeted to an <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A>, you will see that controls are available within the editor to customize that <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A>. Although every different type of <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> will have different sets of properties that may be modified, the manipulation of these properties is as standardized as possible. Below are some general rules that apply:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>String properties inputed via a text field are updated within the object every time a key is pressed</LI>
	<LI>Integer properties inputed via a text field are only updated within the object when return is pressed, or
the input box looses the focus.</LI>
	<LI> Almost without exception, a push button which controls a property, will open up a dialog, allowing the property to be edited. Examples are colors, pixmaps and events.</LI>
	<LI>If when you attempt to modify a property, it returns back to its original value, it means that the value you attempted to enter was invalid. For example, looking at the screen show above, if you enter -50 into the minimum_height text field and press return, it will revert back to 23. This is because the minimum_height of an EV_BUTTON may not be set to less than 0. To find allowable values for properties of an <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A>, consult the <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/00_introduction.html">EiffelVision2</A> documentation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>All properties that may be manipulated in an object editor correspond directly to a property of the <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/00_introduction.html">EiffelVision2</A> control that is represented by the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> (Displayed in an object editor as <B>type</B>). There is one exception to that rule though, and that is the <B>Name</B> field which is specific to EiffelBuild. This field is used for your identification of the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> and as the attribute name in the generated code. For example, when EiffelBuild generates code corresponding to the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> targeted in the editor shown above, it would declare the vision2 component as -  button1: EV_BUTTON</P>

<P CLASS="note"><B>Note</B>:  You may have as many object editors targeted to the same <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> as you wish. Whenever a change is made to the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> through one of the editors, all other editors targeted to that <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> are synchronized.</P>
<H2>Event manipulation</H2>
As well as being able to manipulate the standard properties of an <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A>, facilities are provided for connecting to the events of an <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A>. Looking at the object editor screenshot above, you will see that there is a button marked <B>Modify events</B>.</P>
<P CLASS="note"><B>Note</B>:  The button may also be marked <B>Select events</B> when no events have been selected for the <A HREF="/tools/eiffelbuild/reference/02_notation.html#object">object</A> which the editor is targetted to.</P>

<P>Clicking this button will caUse the following dialog to be displayed:</P>

<P>Looking at the screenshot above, you will see that </P>
