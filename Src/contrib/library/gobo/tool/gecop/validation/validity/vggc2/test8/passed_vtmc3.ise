Error code: VTMC(3)

Error: A renaming cannot be applied to a formal constraint.

What to do: Resolve feature conflicts directly on the constraint type
  which provides the feature. This will be a class type, not a formal.
    MULTI [G -> H rename f as g end, H -> B]
  H is a formal, but you can apply the renaming to B, which is a class type:
    MULTI [G -> H, H -> B rename f as g end]

Class: BB [G -> NONE rename default_create as g end]
Feature: inheritance or invariant clause
It is not allowed to apply a renaming to constraint which is a formal generic or NONE.
Type: detachable NONE
