A system has an attribute of an expanded type, where the base class of
this type also has an expanded attribute.  The system compiles fine
when finalized, but when the system is executed the creation
procedures are called in the wrong order.  If the system is instead
melted or frozen, system execution works as expected.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
