# OpenSSL support for EiffelNet #

Status: working on Windows and Linux

This code is the result of an old patch from Guus Leeuw jr.  (from itpassion.com)
updated by Jocelyn Fiat to void-safety and provided as an extension to EiffelNet.

This supports only Linux and Windows so far.
This "project" is open for contribution, and looking for maintainer.
