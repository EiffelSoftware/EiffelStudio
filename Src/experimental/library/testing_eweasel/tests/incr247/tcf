test_name 	 change-manifest-type-expr
test_description After initial compilation, a routine correctly prints the value of {like Current}.generating_type.  When the expression is changed to {ARRAY [like Current]}.generating_type and system is recompiled, execution prints the wrong value (the one before the change).

define TYPE 	"like Current"
copy_sub 	Ace $TEST Ace
copy_sub 	test.e $CLUSTER test.e
compile_melted
compile_result 	ok

execute_work 	NONE 	exec_output1
execute_result 	ok
compare		exec_output1 output1

define TYPE 	"ARRAY [like Current]"
copy_sub 	test.e $CLUSTER test.e
compile_melted
compile_result 	ok

execute_work 	NONE 	exec_output2
execute_result 	ok
compare		exec_output2 output2

test_end
