The Dynamic External Shared Call (DESC) mechanism provides a way
to call dynamically external functions from a dynamic library.
The current implementation supports 32-bit Windows DLLs and
works only with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.
For more details, see ``ISE Eiffel: The environment'', DESC section.
