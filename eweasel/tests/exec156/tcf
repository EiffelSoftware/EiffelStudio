test_name 	 inherit-create-like-current
test_description A routine which prints `(create {like Current}).generating_type' is written in class A and inherited by class B.  When the routine is called on an object of type B, it prints "A" instead of "B".  If `create {like Current}' is assigned to an attribute of type `like Current', the generating type of this attribute is also incorrect in class B.  But if it is assigned to a local instead, the generating type in B is correct.
