<h1>
Introduction</h1>
The new feature dialog window lets you create simple Eiffel features using
the coding standards described in <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/oosc.html">Object-Oriented
Software Construction, Second Edition</a>. It takes away the drag of writing
set-procedures for attributes and finding the right feature clause in your
class text. The feature wizard can be invoked whenever you have a class
open in a development window. It is also used by the diagram tool when
creating a client-supplier link.

<h2>
Use it when...</h2>

<ul>
<li>
You want to be introduced to the style rules for Eiffel code as described
in <a href="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/oosc.html">Object-Oriented Software
Construction, Second Edition</a>, chapter 26.5 (page 891).</li>

<li>
You want to create an attribute and you also want an invariant and/or a
set-procedure generated for it.</li>

<li>
You want to add a feature in a feature clause that is not in your class
yet, and you do not remember the feature clause order, or you want to add
it in a feature clause that is in your class, but you cannot find it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Do <u>not</u> use it when...</h2>

<ul>
<li>
You want to edit an existing feature. This is not possible, you can only
create new features with it.</li>

<li>
You want to write a more advanced feature. With the feature wizard, you
can enter only a single line of code.</li>
</ul>
