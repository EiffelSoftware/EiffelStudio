You need to have at least a Digital Unix system version 4.0 or higher.
You need to use gcc to compile the C generated code (it won't work if you
are using the DEC `cc')
ISE EiffelBench doesn't support any multithreaded mechanism on Digital Unix.
The license mechanism does not work properly, sometimes you need to restart
the `eifdaemon' program.
