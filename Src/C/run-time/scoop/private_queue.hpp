doc:		<summary> The private queue struct.
doc:
doc:			This structure serves as a central part of communication between
doc:			a client and a supplier. It contains an rt_message_channel for the
doc:			client to send new call data structs.
doc:
doc:			The struct also serves as a lock for the client on the supplier:
doc:			As long as a private queue is inside the queue-of-queues of  the supplier
doc:			the client has exclusive access.
doc:
doc:			Note that the client processor may change during lock passing, i.e.
doc:			it's not guaranteed to be always the client that created the queue.

doc:		<field name="channel", type="struct rt_message_channel"> The message channel used for communication. </field>
doc:		<field name="supplier", type="processor*"> The supplier to whom messages will be sent. This field is constant. Accessed only by the client. </field>
doc:		<field name="lock_depth", type="int"> The current lock depth (for recursive locking). Accessed only by the client. </field>
