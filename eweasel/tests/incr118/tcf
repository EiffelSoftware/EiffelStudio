test_name 	 short-manifest-bit-array-arg
test_description A class calls a a function which takes an argument of type `ARRAY [BIT 500]', passing as actual argument a manifest array of bit constants which are each only 1 bit long.  After initial compilation where the system is frozen, the return type of the function is changed from `BIT 2000' to `BIT 2100' and changes are melted.  System execution then ends with a "bit copy panic (void source)" run-time panic.
