					<P>Eiffel is a method and language for the efficient description and development
					 of quality systems.</P>
					<P>As a language, Eiffel is more than a programming language. It covers not just
					 programming in the restricted sense of implementation but the whole spectrum of
					 software development:</P>
					<UL>
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Analysis</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="italics">modeling</SPAN>
						and <SPAN CLASS="italics">specification</SPAN>, where Eiffel can be used as a 
        purely descriptive tool to analyze and document the structure and 
        properties of complex systems (even non-software systems). 
        
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Design</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="italics">architecture</SPAN>, where Eiffel can be used to 
        build solid, flexible system structures. 
        
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Implementation</SPAN>, where Eiffel provides 
        practical software solutions with an efficiency comparable to solutions 
        based on such traditional approaches as C# or Visual Basic. 
        
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Maintenance</SPAN>, where Eiffel helps thanks to the 
        architectural flexibility of the resulting systems. 
        
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Documentation</SPAN>, where Eiffel permits automatic
						generation of documentation, from the software itself, as a partial substitute
						for separately developed and maintained software documentation.</LI>
					</UL>
					<P>Although the language is the most visible part, Eiffel is best viewed as a
					<SPAN CLASS="bold">method</SPAN>, which guides system analysts and developers through
					the process of software construction. The Eiffel method is focused on both
					productivity (the ability to produce systems on time and within budget) and quality,
					with particular emphasis on the following quality factors:</P>
					<UL>
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Reliability</SPAN>: producing bug-free systems, 
        which perform as expected. 
        
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Reusability</SPAN>: making it possible to develop 
        systems from prepackaged, high-quality components, and to transform 
        software elements into such reusable components for future reuse. 
        
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Extendibility</SPAN>: developing software that is truly
						<SPAN CLASS="italics">soft</SPAN> -- easy to 
        adapt to the inevitable and frequent changes of requirements and other 
        constraints. 
        
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Portability</SPAN>: freeing developers from machine 
        and operating system peculiarities, and enabling them to produce 
        software that will run on many different platforms. 
        
						<LI><SPAN CLASS="italics">Maintainability</SPAN>: yielding software that is clear,
						readable, well structured, and easy to continue enhancing and adapting.</LI>
