= Tutorial Step 1 =
* '''Goal''': learn how to get and install the Eiffel Web Framework
* '''Requirement''': EiffelStudio should be installed

== Get EWF package ==
=== From the archive ===
* Get recent archive of version v1 from https://github.com/EiffelWebFramework/EWF/releases

=== From the source ===
* '''Requirement''': install [http://www.git-scm.org/ git] on your machine
	
 $ git clone -b v1 --recursive https://github.com/EiffelWebFramework/EWF.git ewf

== Install EWF ==
For now, there is nothing specific to do.

(Note: if you want to use the "http_client" library, you will need to do a few extra steps to eventually compile Eiffel Curl.)
