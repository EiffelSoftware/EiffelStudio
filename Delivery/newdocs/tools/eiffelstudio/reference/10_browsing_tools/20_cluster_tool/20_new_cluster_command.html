<h1>New cluster command</h1>
<p>The new cluster command ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_cluster_small_color.gif"> ) located in the cluster tool toolbar creates a cluster
in the same fashion as the main new cluster
command. The only difference is that when using the cluster tool command, the
new cluster is by default located in the cluster selected in the <A HREF="10_cluster_tree.html">cluster tree</a>
(or the selected class's parent cluster, if a class is selected).<p>A dialog is
then popped up in which it is possible to select the name of the new cluster and
the cluster in which the new cluster should be inserted. Only clusters that are
not libraries are displayed in the list.<p>SCREENSHOT(new cluster dialog)<p>Note
that the directory corresponding to the new cluster will have the same name as
the cluster.
