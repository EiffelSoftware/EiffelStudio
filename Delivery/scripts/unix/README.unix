Instructions to build a delivery with a Unix layout
---------------------------------------------------

Motivation
----------
-consistent file layout
-no environment setup needed
-multiple versions can be installed and used at the same time

Before building
---------------
If the default base directory (/usr/local) or the name of the lib dir (lib) should be changed,
adjust set_aliases.

Building
--------
A normal build should be created, e.g. with make_all

After building
--------------
To get a delivery in the unix layout, use the make_unix_layout script

make_unix_layout platform source destination

e.g. under Delivery/scripts/unix where a linux-x86-64 delivery has been generated

./make_unix_layout linux-x86-64 PorterPackage/Eiffel64 unix_layout

will generate a delivery in the unix_layout directory.

At the end, the precompiles should be built using the freshly built delivery.
