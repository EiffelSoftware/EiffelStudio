An external routine has a signature specified (e.g., "C (double):
long") to cause casting of a result before it is passed back to the
Eiffel side.  The external routine is redefined in a descendant.  In a
call to the routine which is statically bound, the cast is not applied
to the result of the function call in the generated C code if the
system is finalized.  This results in wrong results when the system is
executed.  A frozen system works correctly.

Discovered in Release 3.3.7.
