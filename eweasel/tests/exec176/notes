A routine which does an assignment attempt of a TUPLE to a local that
is a TUPLE type with an anchored type (e.g., `TUPLE [like i, INTEGER,
INTEGER]') works correctly if the anchored type is `like Current'.  It
does not work correctly if anchored to a routine argument.  In
finalized mode, it also does not work correctly if anchored to an
attribute.

Discovered in release 5.4.0730.
