test_name 	 multithreaded-memory-leak
test_description A system repeatedly creates one thread (which has an empty `execute' procedure) and then calls join_all to wait for it to terminate.  As the number of threads which have been created increases, the memory used by the executing system keeps growing, apparently without limit. After 4000 threads have been created, system memory usage is about 90 MB.
