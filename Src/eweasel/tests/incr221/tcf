test_description Class A has a qualified call to one of its own features, where the feature is exported only to B and its descendants.  This is valid since class A is a descendant of B.  But when the inheritance clause is removed, so that A is no longer a descendant of B, and the system is recompiled, the VUEX violation is not detected.
