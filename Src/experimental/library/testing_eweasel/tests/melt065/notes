A system whose Ace specifies `profile (yes)' is melted.  When the
system is executed with the EIFGEN/W_code directory as the current
directory with the MELT_PATH environment variable not set, system
execution attempts to create the "profinfo" file in the wrong place
(not in the EIFGEN/W_code directory).

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
