	description: "[
		Shared access to a global service provider.
		
		Note: `service_provider' provides uniformed access to a global service heap. There should only be one
		heap per application to avoid confusion. Any class requiring access to a service should inherit or
		use {SHARED_SERVICE_PROVIDER} as a client.
		
		On first initialization a service heap {SERVICE_HEAP} will be created to store and maintain a list of services.
		After initialization three services will be registered. 
			* {SERVICE_CONTAINER} provides access to the global service container by passing any chained container.
			* {SERVICE_PROVIDER} provides access to the global service provider by passing any chained provider.
			* {SERVICE_HEAP} providess access to the global service heap.
