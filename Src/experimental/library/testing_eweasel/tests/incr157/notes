A pair of generic classes that mention each other in their formal
generic constraints is invalid.  After the compiler correctly detects
the VTCG error, one of the actual generics in the constraint is
changed.  Compilation then terminates with a segmentation violation
and no exception trace at all.

Discovered in Release 5.0.015.
