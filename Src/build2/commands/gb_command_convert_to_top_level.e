		-- Id of representation of object with id `child_id' that is created.

	original_ids: ARRAYED_LIST [INTEGER]
		-- All original ids of objects contained in new object created first time that `Current' is
		-- executed. As each time we re-execute `Current' we create a new object structure so that any
		-- modified properties are not lost, we need to keep all of the original ids to set them back
		-- into the structure each time that it is subsequently created. Otherwise, if you convert a structure
		-- to a top level structure and then build into it, undoing the history and redoing causes EiffelBuild
		-- to crash as the add command cannot find the object with the same id as was originally built into.
		-- As soon as there is a way to implement `Current' without re-building the structure each time,
		-- this step should be no longer required.

	parent_directory_path: ARRAYED_LIST [STRING]
		-- Parent directory path containing new conversion. If empty, the parent is the `widget_selector'.
