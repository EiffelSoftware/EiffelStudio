test_name 	wrong-field-count
test_description A class creates an instance of INTERNAL and uses it to print the field count of the current object.  The system compiles fine when frozen and correctly prints 0 when executed.  Then an attribute is added to the class and changes are melted.  System execution then incorrectly still prints 0, instead of 1.
