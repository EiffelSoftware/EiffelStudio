test_name 	invariant-veen-skip-invariant
test_description After initial compilation where the system is melted, an entity name in a class invariant is changed to the name of a nonexistent entity. When the compiler reports the VEEN error, the entity name is changed back to its original value and compilation completes.  But execution of the resulting system, which was compiled with `assertion (all)', does not monitor class invariants.
