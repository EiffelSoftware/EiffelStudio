A class with a generic parameter with a constraint `-> STRING create
xxx end' is compiled.  The compiler correctly reports a VTCG error.
When `xxx' is changed to `make' and compilation is resumed,
compilation should finish but the compiler dies in degree 4 on the
class.

Discovered in release 5.4.0403.
