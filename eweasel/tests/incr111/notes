A class has a routine with an assignment whose source entity is an an
attribute of the class.  After initial compilation where the system is
melted, the type of the source entity is changed to another type which
is a parent of the original source entity type and the system is
frozen.  System execution then ends with a segmentation fault.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
