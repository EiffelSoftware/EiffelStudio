	description:

"[
		Routines for handling exceptioms within the XPath and XSLT libraries.
		Note that no exceptions actually leak out to the interface.
		This class is necessary as not all XPath atomic values are comparable.
		XSLT requires raising error XTDE1030 when this happens.
		The problem is that although XM_XPATH_ATOMIC_VALUE has a routine `are_comparable'
		as a pre-condition for routine `three_way_comparison', this is not checked
		by {DS_SORTER}.sort.
		So instead {XM_XPATH_ATOMIC_COMPARER}.less_than will make the check prior
		to calling `three_way_comparison', and raise an exception if the check fails.
		This exception will then be caught by routine `perform_sorting' of classes
		XM_XSLT_SORTED_NODE_ITERATOR and XM_XSLT_SORTED_ITERATOR, which will set the
		XTDE1030 error condition.
		This class provides for sharing the common features between these classes.
