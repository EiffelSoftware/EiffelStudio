Opening new windows</h1>
There are several ways to open a new window. First, you can use the pick
and drop shortcut. Then, you can use new window menu items and the corresponding
icons. There are three such commands:
<ul>
<li>
Clicking on <b>New window</b> in the <b>File</b> menu or on&nbsp;<img SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_development_tool_color.gif" >
make an new window appear. In this window, the editor and the context tool
will be visible.</li>

<li>
Clicking on <b>New editor window</b> in the <b>File</b> menu or on&nbsp;<img SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_editor_color.gif" >
does the same as the previous command but the context tool is minimized
in the new window.</li>

<li>
Clicking on <b>New context window</b> in the <b>File</b> menu or on&nbsp;<img SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_new_context_window_color.gif" >
make this time a new window with a minimized editor appear.</li>
</ul>

<div CLASS="Note"><b>Note</b>: Icons mentioned above are droppable: instead
of simply clicking on them, you can drop a stone on them. The tools in
the new window will then be centered on the corresponding component.</div>
