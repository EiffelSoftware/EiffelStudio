			A widget is a basic building block of a Vision2 application. In order to build a Vision2 application, you combine widgets
			to produce the desired GUI. All widgets inherit <A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chart.html">EV_WIDGET</A> which provides
			many basic features such as <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_show">show</A>, <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_hide">hide</A>,
			<A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_set_minimum_width">set_minimum_width</A> and <A CLASS="efeature" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget.html#f_set_minimum_height">set_minimum_height<A>.
			<A CLASS="eclass" HREF="/libraries/vision2/reference/interface/widgets/ev_widget_chart.html">EV_WIDGET</A> and therefore every Vision2 widget also inherits many common <A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/properties/index.html">properties</A>.

			Within Vision2, widgets have been classified into three different groups:
			<UL>
				<LI><A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/widgets/primitives/index.html">Primitives</A>
                  -- These are elements of the user interface that are mainly
                  responsible for interaction with the user, such as an
                  EV_BUTTON.
				<LI><A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/widgets/containers/index.html">Containers</A>
                  -- These are used to contain other widgets and position them
                  in a certain way, such as an EV_VERTICAL_BOX that stacks its
                  children one by one vertically
				<LI><A HREF="/libraries/vision2/content/widgets/common_dialogs/index.html">Common_dialogs</A>
                  -- These are Operating System dependant popup dialog windows
                  used for interacting with the user for tasks such as opening a
                  file (EV_FILE_OPEN_DIALOG)
