test_name 	remove-syntax-warning-yes
test_description A system whose Ace specifies `syntax_warning (yes)' is compiled and the compiler issues warning about obsolete syntax.  Then this clause is removed from the Ace file and a new use of obsolete syntax is added.  The compiler warns about the new use of obsolete syntax, but it should not.
