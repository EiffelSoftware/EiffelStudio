  ; "core" specifies the version of Drupal that this theme is compatible with.
  ; "base theme" specifies that this is a theme that uses the "zen" theme as its
  ; base theme. Its unlikely you will ever need to change these, but they are

  ; This section adds CSS files to your theme. The media type is specified in

  ; list of stylesheet media types in CSS 2.1.
  ;
  ; You can also override any of Zen's stylesheets or any module's stylesheets,
  ; an /extremely/ useful feature. See the excellent Drupal 6 Theme Guide at

  ; To prevent stylesheets of a base theme or of a module from being included in

  ; variable in the page.tpl.php file.) The text after the equals sign is a
  ; descriptive text used on the admin/build/blocks page.
  ;
  ; To add a new region, copy Zen's page.tpl.php to your sub-theme's directory,
  ; add a line line to this file, and then add the new variable to your
  ; page.tpl.php template.
