		<h1>Exception Mechanism</h1>
		<h2>Motivation: Concerning Robustness</h2>
		<p>The notion of software correctness that we saw in&nbsp;<A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/60_Design_By_Contract.htm">Design
				by Contract and Assertions</A>&nbsp;is half of the formula for software
			reliability. Correctness covers what the software is supposed to do, that is,
			its specification.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<P>Of course,&nbsp;there is always a potential for things to go out of the bounds
			of the specification. This happens, for example&nbsp;if a client makes a call
			to a routine from a state in which the routine's precondition is not true.
		</P>
		<P>How well software responds to situations which outside specification is called
			robustness. Together correctness and robustness define software reliability.</P>
		<H2>Consequences of Contracts</H2>
		<P>In the presence of Design by Contract, what happens&nbsp;to running software
			boils down to a simple rule:</P>
		<P>A routine call&nbsp;can complete in one of only two ways:
		</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			The routine&nbsp;fulfills its contract.
			<LI>
				The routine fails&nbsp;to fulfill its contract.</LI></OL>
		<P>As a follow-on, we can add that:
		<UL>
			<LI>Any routine that fails to fulfill its contract
				must cause an exception in its caller.
		</UL>
		</P>
		<H2>Reacting to Exceptions</H2>
		<P>Again, because of Design by Contract, we can state the following rule for
			dealing with exceptions:</P>
		<P>A routine that incurs an exeception can react in one of only two ways:</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			It can return the instance to a stable state and retry the entire routine with
			the same or a different strategy.
			<LI>
				It can fail, causing an exception in its caller.</LI></OL>
		<P>There is an Eiffel mechanism called the rescue clause which facilitates the
			first alternative.</P>
		<H3>The Rescue Clause</H3>
		<P>The <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">rescue</SPAN> clause is part of the routine structure we saw in <A href="../../eiffel_for_dotnet/30_Adding_Class_Features.htm">
				Adding Class Features</A>. The rescue clause is a sequence of instructions
				introduced by the keyword "<SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">rescue</SPAN>".
			At the point that an exception occurs, the processing of the normal
			instructions in the routine body will cease, and the instructions in the rescue
			clause will be executed instead.</P>
		<P>If the instructions in the rescue clause can set things up so that it
			might&nbsp;prove fruitful to attempt to retry the routine, it can do so by
			issuing a <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">retry</SPAN> instruction. When the <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">retry</SPAN> instruction is executed, the
			routine is restarted from its beginning, although local entities are not
			re-initialized. You will see why in&nbsp;the example below.</P>
		<P>If the rescue clause exits without issuing a <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">retry</SPAN> instruction, then the routine
			fails.</P>
		<P>It should be noted that rescue clauses and retry instructions are not something
			that are used commonly. Out of the approximately 2000 class in the delivered
			Eiffel libraries, there are only 16 occurrences. Many of these are oriented
			toward network and database operations for which some reasonable recovery might
			be possible.</P>

		</CODE>
		<P>In the example above, <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">rescue</SPAN> is used to recover from a situation in which an
			exception occurs in trying to send a packet. When the exception occurs the
			rescue clause will, if the maximum number of retries has not been reached, wait
			for some random length of time. Then, after having updated the number of
			retries, it will issue the <SPAN CLASS="ekeyword">retry</SPAN> instruction. If the maximum number of retries
			is reached, the rescue clause will exit without executing the retry,
			constituting a failure.</P>
