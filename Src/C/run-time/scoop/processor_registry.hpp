	 * Although the procs array is accessed by several threads,
	 * it is not necessary to synchronize the access. There are several
	 * properties that make it unnecessary:
	 * 
	 * Data race freedom:
	 * - A new value is inserted by the creator thread after it received
	 *   a new unique PID from the free_pids set. 
	 * - After creation, the field remains constant.
	 * - The value is reset to NULL only by the thread behind the specified
	 *   processor ID, after the garbage collector concluded that it is no
	 *   longer referenced anywhere.
	 * - The uniqueness of PIDs is guaranteed by the free_pids set. A new 
	 *   ID has to be acquired before adding an entry in 'procs', and it
	 *   can only be released after resetting 'procs' to NULL.
	 * 
	 * Visibility:
	 * - Generally, x86 has strong visibility guarantees, and by creating
	 *   initializing the processor object before adding it to 'procs'
	 *   any other thread can see a consistent view.
	 * - The update to the procs array itself is visible in the garbage collector,
	 *   because the creator thread synchronizes with the GC thread prior to a cycle.
	 * - The same applies during removal of a processor.
	 * - Between the creator thread and the spawned thread, visibility is guaranteed
	 *   because of the thread creation operation.
	 * - In between processors, visibility is guaranteed because the creator first
	 *   has to publish the root object of the new processor, and as soon as this
	 *   object is visible by other threads the update is visible as well, thanks
	 *   to the visibility guarantees of x86.
