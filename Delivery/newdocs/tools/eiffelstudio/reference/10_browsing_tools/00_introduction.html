<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The browsing tools are all the tools that are in the left panel of the
development windows as well as the address bars. They help find an item in the
system, such as a class, a cluster, a feature, some text, ... They include the
<A HREF="10_address_bars/introduction.html">address bars</a>,
the <A HREF="20_cluster_tool/introduction.html">cluster tool</a>,
the <A HREF="30_feature_tool/introduction.html">feature tool</a>,
the <A HREF="40_favorites_tool/introduction.html">favorites tool</a>,
the <A HREF="50_windows_tool/introduction.html">windows tool</a> and the
<A HREF="60_search_tool.html">search tool</a>.
<p>The main address bar may be shown or hidden
by using the <b>View</b>/<b>Toolbars</b>/<b>Address Bar</b> menu, or by
right-clicking on the right of the toolbar and clicking <b>Address bar</b> in
the popped up context menu.<p>All left-hand tools can be hidden or shown
using their associated toolbar button, or through the <b>View</b>/<b>Explorer
Bar</b> menu. They also all have a common mini-toolbar that handles window-like
features:
<ul>
	<li>
<b>
Minimize</b> ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_minimize_color.gif"> ) iconifies the tool, and leaves only its toolbar
visible at
the bottom of the panel.
	<li>
<b>
Maximize</b> ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_maximize_color.gif"> ) enlarges the tool so that it occupies the whole space of the
development window.
	<li>
<b>
Restore</b> ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_restore_color.gif"> ), available whenever a tool has been minimized or maximized,
puts it back to its previous state.
	<li>
<b>
Close</b> ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icon_close_color.gif"> ) discards the tool from the panel, as if its associated
toolbar button
had been pressed.
</ul>

<p><b>Note</b>: No more than three tools can be displayed at the same time in
the left panel. Trying to add more will automatically minimize one of the
displayed tools, in order to make room for the new tool.</p>
