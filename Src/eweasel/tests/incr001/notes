A system with two classes compiles fine.  A violation of the Expanded
Client rule (VLEC) is introduced and the compiler detects it.  But
when the formal generic parameter of the class violating the rule is
removed, compilation is resumed and then the formal generic parameter
is added back, the VLEC violation is still there but the compiler does
not detect it.

Discovered in Prerelease 93.07.15.
