IMPORTANT NOTE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since some people do not have a C compiler, we provide for most of the
examples a version that does not require a C compiler.

In each directory you will find two ace files:
- "ace.ace", for those who have a C compiler.

- "ace_with_precompiled.ace", for those who do not have a C compiler.
  In a few cases (comctrls, cursors, magnify), we provide a strip down 
  version of the 'C-compiler' version.
  These examples require to have a precompiled library of EiffelBase
  and WEL.
  
The following examples do not work without a freeze which requires a
C compiler:
- commands
- fontenum
- fun
- pizza
- richedit
- windows
- xcell

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NB: Theses examples have been successfully tested under EiffelStudio 5.0,
using the latest WEL and EiffelBase library.
