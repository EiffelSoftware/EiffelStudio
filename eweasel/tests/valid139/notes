A class FOO has a generic parameter G of type XXX with a generic
creation clause `create default_create end'.  Another class declares
an attribute of type FOO [XXX], where `default_create' is not listed
as a creation procedure of XXX.  The compiler should report a VTCG
error but does not.

Discovered in release 5.4.0515.
