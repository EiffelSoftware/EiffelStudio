Lace error: Visible clause lists class which is not reachable from root.
What to do: if class is indeed not needed, remove it from Visible
  clause. Otherwise change system so that it includes the class.
  (Note: the class may have been originally reachable from the
  root class, but disconnected later as a result of changes.)
