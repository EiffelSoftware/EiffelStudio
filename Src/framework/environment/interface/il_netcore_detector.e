class
	IL_NETCORE_DETECTOR

feature -- Initialization

	is_il_netcore (version: READABLE_STRING_GENERAL): BOOLEAN
		do
				-- TODO: implement a smart netcore detection. [2023-05-19]
			Result := version.has ('/')
				-- Currently, EiffelStudio internally uses
				--   vx.y.z (such as v4.0.30319) for .net framework
				--   Microsoft.NETCore.App/x.y.z for netcore
				-- So the presence of '/' is a quick hack to detect netcore
