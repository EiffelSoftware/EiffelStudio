		<H1>Header comment</H1>

		<P>In the header comment field you can type a description of the feature. For style guidelines in writing a header comment, see: <A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/oosc.html">Object-Oriented Software Construction, Second Edition</A>, paragraph 26.4. The description should be informative, clear and terse.</P>

		<P>Let's say you want to make an attribute <SPAN CLASS="efeature">count</SPAN>. Then you may enter a header comment in the comment field:</P>

		<CENTER>
		<IMG SRC="../../../../images/EiffelBench/feature-wizard-comment.png">
		</CENTER><BR>

		When clicking <B>OK</B> this code is generated:
		<CODE><PRE>    count: INTEGER
            -- Number of students in course.</PRE></CODE>

        <P>The attribute is indented by one, the header comment by three, which makes it stand out nicely. There is a space between the double dash and the start of the comment.</P>

        <P CLASS="tip"><B>Tip</B>: start your comment with a capital and end it with a dot (or a question mark, for boolean queries).</P>
