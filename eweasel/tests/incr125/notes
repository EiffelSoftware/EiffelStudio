A class has routines which take an argument of type INTEGER, REAL,
DOUBLE or ANY and calls to these routines passing an INTEGER. REAL or
DOUBLE constant or variable.  After initial compilation where the
system is frozen, formal argument types are change to a more general
type (e.g., INTEGER is changed to REAL or DOUBLE or ANY, etc).  When
changes are melted, system execution produces the wrong output and
then a segmentation fault.

Discovered in Release 3.2.4.
