		Functions used to implement capture beyond the boundaries of the process.
		Because the hook processing WH_MOUSE_LL is done in the thread that installed it,
		it means that by default it would be in the GUI thread. That would slow down
		mouse movement if the application responds to move events (such as drawing the
		line for pick and drop under Vista/Windows 7 and the desktop composition).
		Therefore we install the hook in its own thread.
