Test add-remove-constraint-vtcg (incr146): failed
	Description: After initial compilation, a constraint on a formal generic parameter of a class that is used in the generic constraint of another class is changed.  When the system is recompiled, the compiler correctly reports a VTCG error.  But when the constraint is changed back to its original valid form and compilation is resumed, the compiler dies with a bus error.
