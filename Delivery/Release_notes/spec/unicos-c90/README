RELEASE NOTE FOR CRAY unicos-C90 VERSION.

Please your PLATFORM environment variable to unicos-c90 if you
are running on CRAY unicos-c90. 

This version of ISE Eiffel provides only the run-times located
$EIFFEL5/bench/spec/unicos-c90/lib/. . You will also found
the binary `finish_freezing' to compile the generated C-code in
	$EIFFEL5/bench/spec/unicos-c90/bin/.

To run an Eiffel program on CRAY you need to compile the
Eiffel code on another platform. Then, you will be able to compile
the generated C-code by launching `finish_freezing' on CRAY in
the <your_system_path>/EIFGEN/F_code .

PORTABILITY OF GENERATED C CODE
-------------------------------

Only the run-time in finalized mode is provided.
The Finalized C code (in EIFGEN/F_code) is fully portable between all the 
supported platforms.

SETTINGS BEFORE LAUNCHING C COMPILATION
---------------------------------------

You may have to unset TARGET and use the production compiler before any
compilation:

setting the production compiler:
% eval `setpe prod`

unsetting TARGET:
% unsetenv TARGET

Updating PLATFORM:
% setenv PLATFORM unicos-c90

BUGS ON CRAY
------------

The loader does not work properly: the ISE compiler uses the archiver `ar' instead. Therefore, the CECIL library cannot be automatically generated.

SHARED LIBRARY
--------------

No shared Eiffel run-time library is provided.
