A generic class whose formal generic parameter G is constrained by
STRING has a call to an agent whose open target is {G}.  After initial
compilation, the generic constraint is removed.  When the system is
recompiled, the compiler does not detect the newly introduced VEEN
error.

Discovered in release 5.4.0610.
