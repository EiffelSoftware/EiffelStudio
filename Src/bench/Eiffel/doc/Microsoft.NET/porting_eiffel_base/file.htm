<h1>FILE</h1>
<h2>Used .NET classes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>FILEINFO
	<li>FILESTREAM
	<li>IntPtr (POINTER)
	<li>DateTime
</ul>
<h2>Static methods used</h2>
<ul>
	<li>None
</ul>
<h2>Security notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Users need the correct permissions to access information relative to files.
</ul>
<h2>Unhandled exceptions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All permission exceptions triggered by FILE.
	<li>Exceptions raised when a file doesn't exist.
	<li>There are conversions from int64 to int32 here and there (count, file_descriptor,...), which may
	raise overflow exceptions.
</ul>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>The behavior mimics the behavior under Windows (no inode, no user, etc).
<p>File descriptors are supported, but they require a C call: they are not natively supported by .NET.
<p>Haven't figured out yet how to implement the retrieve process.
<p>Reopening files doesn't work. reopen* only closes the file and opens another one, according to the parameter name.
<p>Link doesn't do anything. I believe it was already the case on Windows anyway.
<p>Adding and removing permissions on files is not supported.
<p>extend and copy_to seem buggy to me (extend does a put_character, copy_to erases the contents of last_string (which is a side effect)),
but those are the behaviors in Base.
<p>There is no precondition on put*!! There is definitely a design issue here.
<p>There is no way to read a boolean in a file. This seems crappy (it is possible to write one).
