An attribute `weasel' of a class has the type of the formal generic
parameter, which is constrained by `LINKED_LIST [STRING]'.  The
expression `weasel.i_th (1)' should therefore be of type STRING.  But
an assignment to a local of type STRING is rejected as a VJAR error.
The compiler seems to think the expression is of type `Generic #1'.

Discovered in Release 3.2.3b.
