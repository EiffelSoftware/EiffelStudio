<h1>Execute one line at a time</h1>
<p>If no application was already running, this command launches an application HYPERLINK(compile in workbench mode) compiled in WorkBench
mode and stops at its first line.<p>If an application was stopped, it attempts to execute the instruction located on the execution
line where the application is stopped. If this execution line does not contain an instruction, the execution stops at the next execution line.
<p>It is
accessible through the <b>project</b> toolbar ( <IMG SRC="/images/eiffelstudio/icons/icon_exec_step_color.gif" width="16" height="16"> ) 
or through the <b>debug</b> menu.
