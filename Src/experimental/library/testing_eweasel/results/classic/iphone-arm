	Description: A system with two classes is compiled.  The compiler detects the syntax error on the second class.  Then the root class is changed so that the second class is no longer reachable from the root.  When compilation is resumed, the compiler still reports a syntax error on the unreachable class.

A second class inherits this class and provides FOO as actual generic parameter.  The actual argument in the call to the routine is of type `expanded FOO'.  After initial compilation where the system is frozen, the actual generic parameter is changed to `expanded FOO' and changes are melted.  Then the actual generic is changed back to `FOO'.  System execution then dies with a segmentation fault.

Test big-array-of-bit (exec074): failed
	Description: A class creates an ARRAY [BIT 32] and fills it with elements of type BIT 32.  Executing the system results in a run-time panic if the size of the array is big enough (approximately 4500), but only if garbage collection is on.  If garbage collection is off, a 500_000 element array works fine.
